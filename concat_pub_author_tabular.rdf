	<dc:abstract>In this paper, morphological and capitalization features are employed to improve the current word embedding-based POS tagger for Bahasa Indonesia. The experiments are conducted with an architecture based on neural network model, that is a simple feedforward neural network with two input layers, one merge layer, and two hidden layers. The first input layer uses word embeddings (CBOW and Skip-gram) feature as the input while the second input layer uses morphological and capitalization features. The results show that the selected additional features improve the performance and accuracy of current word embedding-based POS tagger, although it is not really significant. The F1 score averages of all word embedding types are increasing from 93% to 94% and the accuracies are increasing from 92-93% to 94-95% on manually tagged corpus of about 250,000 tokens (12,775 unique tokens). © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper evaluates Part-of-Speech Tagging for the formal Indonesian language can be used for the tagging process of Indonesian tweets. In this study, we add five additional tags which reflect to social media attributes to the existing original tagset. Automatic POS tagging process is done by stratified training process with 1000, 1600, and 1800 of annotated tweets. It shows that the process can achieve up to 66.36% accuracy. The experiment with original tagset gives slightly better accuracy (67.39%) than the experiment with five additional tags, but will lose important informations which given by the five additional tagset.POS-Tagging for Informal Language (Study in Indonesian Tweets). © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The studied approach to part-of-speech tagging for tweets in Bahasa Indonesia. Bahasa Indonesia, as well as many other non-English languages, are lacking in language processing resources. This is mainly due to the lack of usable local corpus. This paper describes our work on building tweet corpus in Bahasa Indonesia that have been tagged manually using tag set from previous work with the addition of new tags specifically for tweet data. This corpus then used to train neural network based tagger. The experiment results for training process obtained Skip-Gram model with 66.23% testing accuracy and 66.33% validation accuracy, f1 score for all model close 60% accuracy in POS tagger testing model and shows that the tagger can assign tags with the acceptable result using word vector as features. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The robustness against environmental distortions of various features used in speech recognition: MFCC, PLP, LPCC, FBANK, MELSPEC, ETSI - AFE, and PNCC are compared in this paper. These features are evaluated on Aurora-2, English spoken digit recognition task, a popular corpus often used to evaluate the robustness of speech recognition approaches. The results show that the use of different types of filter bank such as mel-scale filter bank in MFCC and Bark scale filter bank in PLP, achieves similar performance. The robustness of speech recognition features against environmental distortions are improved by using DCT even though the performances of features with and without DCT are comparable in clean conditions. PNCC, the current state-of-the-art feature generally shows a better performance compared to traditional features, except ETSI - AFE. Need to be noted that ETSI - AFE is found to be bias on Aurora-2 task. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Along with the advancement in the technology, a lot of newer and better technology are introduced. However, there are many cases where users don't want to adopt new and better technology, instead, they keep using the old technology. This problem of users' inertia, not wanting to switch to new technology, is now being faced by Cookpad Indonesia. Only a few Cookpad mobile web users that want to switch to use Cookpad mobile application. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors, enablers and inhibitors, that influence Cookpad mobile website users to switch to use Cookpad mobile application. Two-factor theory, which states that there are enablers and inhibitors that work independently to influence behavior, is used as a theoretical framework for this research. Quantitative data using Likert scale was collected through questionnaire survey targeting Cookpad Indonesia users. There were 406 questionnaires collected, with 331 of them are valid. SEM covariant based was used to analyze survey result using AMOS software. Functional deprivation, interactivity, and social identification were identified as enablers, while inertia was identified as inhibitors for users' intention to switch from mobile website to mobile application. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>The determinants of consumer purchase intention of online game voucher: A case study of upoint online store</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>This study aims to determine the factors that influence consumer purchase intention in using online game voucher provider sites. To answer the research question, this study adopted previous theory namely TAM and Affect-Behavior-Cognition (ABC). Data collection research was conducted by disseminating online questionnaires. The sample criteria used in this study are people who have played online games who have or have never used UPoint to purchase online game vouchers and have enough knowledge of UPoint Store online game voucher sales sites. Finally, the collected data was processed by using Structural Equation Modelling by SMARTPLS. From the research, it can be concluded that the factors that influence consumer purchase intention are: Technology Attributes in the form of Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Risk, and Product attributes in the form of Product Price and Product Quality. Attitude, satisfaction affects consumer purchase intention through the Stickiness factor. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Internet users in Indonesia are growing quite large, affecting the development of online s-commerce businesses. Previously, research related to s-commerce only focused on the interaction side on social media. Meanwhile, s-commerce does not only involve the interaction side, but also the relational and transactional side. This study uses all three sides to analyze the factors that influence consumer trust to buy in s-commerce. This research was conducted with a quantitative method by distributing online questionnaires through surveymonkey.com. There were 404 respondents who filled out the questionnaires. The statistical analysis used in this study was Partial Least Square (PLS) SEM with the help of SmartPLS v.3.2.1 software. This study concludes that transaction safety, relationship maintenance and rating can influence consumers trust and trust can influence consumers intention to buy in s-commerce business. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore the enabling factors associated with readiness in Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementation and to identify the barriers related to readiness regarding the situation of primary health cares in developed and developing countries. Methods: A narrative review of open-source literature was conducted using the ProQuest, ScienceDirect, MEDLINE, and PMC databases to identify the enabling factors and barriers to EHR readiness. The keywords applied were ‘electronic health record’, ‘readiness’, ‘primary health care’, and ‘primary care’. Results: Some barriers were found that may affect readiness, specifically individual barriers and organizational barriers. In developing countries, organizational barriers such as a lack of skilled manpower, insufficient senior management, and a lack of interaction among team members were the common barriers, while in developed countries individual barriers such as unfamiliarity with new systems and a lack of time to use computers were frequently found as barriers to readiness. Conclusions: This study summarized the enabling factors and barriers with regard to EHR readiness in developed and developing countries. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The idea of immune system as a computing inspiration has given rise to the Artificial Immune System (AIS). AIS has contributed in the field of optimization of complex issues, one of which is a clonal selection algorithm (CSA) for solving the Optimization Problem such as Traveling Salesperson Problems (TSP). Parallel characteristic inherently possessed by the immune system, provided an opportunity to give parallel computing to achieve better computational performance. The study resulted in two parallel models for the clonal selection algorithm. First model is a master-slave model, there is a master process that controls all communication. In the second model, all processes equivalent and communicate with each other. Both models are prepared to be built in system development with parallel environment using Visual C# language with MPI.NET framework. For both datasets, experiment gave consistent results. Model 1 is superior in getting the best-tour’s cost, although obtained with longer execution time, compared with Model 2.

	<dc:abstract>Information quality (IQ) has received considerable attention in various sectors due to its critical impact on the accuracy of decision-making process. Many organizations are aware of having problems with their information quality, but often facing difficulty to measure IQ capability. This study aims to develop a model that will be used to measure information quality by adopting PSP/IQ Model. Data was collected through focus group discussion and internal survey. IQ model development was carried out by using Analytical Hierarchy Process methodology. The final model concludes the priority of IQ aspects is in the same level priority with the same weighted score of 0,25. Furthermore, three dimensions that have the highest priority are consecutively security (0.188), free-of-error (0.137), and reputation (0.112). The result of information quality measurement shows that relevancy (3,29) has the highest satisfaction score among others. Finally, gap analysis was discussed to propose further improvement priority of the IQ dimension. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The competitiveness level in business has risen and companies must be more resilience and competitive. Companies are expected to optimize their limited resources and focusing on their business core activities, so that they could increase the quality of their products or services. One of solutions for gaining efficiency is to outsource the peripheral services. In this study, we design a framework for measuring the success level of IT outsourcing implementation in a company. We used the framework in a our case study to assess the company's success level. Furthermore, we analyze the supporting factors for the success. In designing the framework, we use Analytic Hierarchy Process. In the result of our study, it shows that the case study is on medium level of the success level of IT outsourcing implementation. This shows that IT outsourcing is beneficial to the company but it has not help the company to reach their main objectives. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information system for supply chain processes is known as e-SCM (electronic supply chain management). The system is expected to provide benefits toward the organization. The benefits of the e-SCM can be represented as its effectiveness towards the organization. The purpose of this study is to analyze factors that influence the effectiveness of the use of e-SCM. The proposed model in this study adopts DeLone-McLean model and thus investigates the relationship between information quality, system quality, service quality to use, user satisfaction, and the net benefit. A case of XYZ in Indonesia is used to give context to the study. XYZ is a company that runs its business within the telecommunications industry. In providing services to its consumers, XYZ uses a computer-based information system for SCM (e-SCM), namely Sitehandler. Data from 149 respondents were collected via questionnaires. The data were processed using PLS-SEM. The results showed that there is positive correlation between information quality toward user satisfaction and usage. Likewise, system quality influences positively the user satisfaction and usage. However, service quality in this study does not positively influence user satisfaction and usage. Usage has a positive influence on user satisfaction and net benefit. Also, user satisfaction has a positive influence on the net benefit. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Technology, particularly social media, is growing. Governments that are being intensively build government services electronically can see social media as an ever-growing oppurtunities to support the development of egovernment, especially e-participation. Students, who are considered as drivers of change in Indonesia, are the largest social media users. Therefore, it is important for the government to reach out to students to be willing to participate electronically to the government program. This study seeks to determine criteria of social media selection to increase student participation to government. This study also tries to develop a hierarchy for evaluating social media preferences and prioritize the social media that are currently popular to support e-participation. Based on the results literature study and FGD, we obtained 11 criteria of social media selection to increase participation and 8 alternative solutions that best fit the criteria. Criteria is determined based on the theory of motivation (hedonic and utilitarian). Data collection is done through a questionnaire. Data processing is done by using fuzzy AHP to determine the weight of social media to increase the participation of the government and TOPSIS to determine social media preferences. The result of this study shows that LINE becomes an alternative solution of social media that has the highest priority while Wiki has the lowest priority. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In order to achieve public sector reform and more transparent public information disclosure, the Supreme Court of Republic Indonesia developed the Court Case Information System (CCIS). The CCIS are used by the four judicial systems under Supreme Court: General Court, Military Court, State Administration Court, and Religious Court. Although CCIS has developed in 2011, the internal audit conducted in 2015 shows that CCIS only have 40% active users. Moreover, no assessment has been conducted to investigate what factors may play roles in improving users' intention to use CCIS. This study uses quantitative methods using technology-organizationenvironment (TOE) theory and adds individual contexts to investigate factors affecting individual intentions to use CCIS. There are ten variables tested involving 296 respondents and analyzed by using PLS-SEM approach. The results of this study show that top management support, organization regulation, ease of use, usefulness, self-efficacy and social influence are the factors that may help improving users' intention to use CCIS. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesian government has been mandated in presidential decree regarding bureaucratic reform to realize its commitment to implement electronic government (egovernment) based on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This notion has caused the dependency of business process functions of government services to the public, using ICTs. Increased use of ICTs leads to high levels of vulnerability that can be exploited by major threats. The largest source of the information security breaches is due to a lack of awareness of the human aspect. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) RI has a strategic problem concerning the awareness of employees. This study measured awareness of information security. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the importance of each of those dimensions through pairwise comparison. Measurements conducted using questionnaire to all employees of the MOFA. Focus areas measured include: workstation security, password management, the use of email and instant messaging, internet usage, the use of social media, document handling, incident reporting, and security policies. The result shows that the security awareness of employees at the MOFA is at the average level, or in need of attention and supervision. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Along with the increasing use of information and communication technology, information security becomes something fundamental. BATAN as one of the government agencies currently wants to increase the security awareness of its employees. As a national nuclear agency, information security awareness is crucial, as it relates to the safety of the society. This study aims to know how the relationship between the three variables of knowledge, attitude and behavior in BATAN. A nuclear agency has a special characteristics of information security because it has a higher standard related to information security than other institutions. By knowing how the interaction of these three variables, is expected to know how to improve employee behavior toward information security. The arrangement of research variables and instruments is done through Focus Group Discussion (FGD). FGD results were then compiled into questionnaires, distributed to 420 Batan employees. From 420 questionnaire, 381 was returned and processed using regression analysis. As a result, it is known that employee knowledge of information security affects employee attitudes to information security, employee attitudes to information security affect employee behavior in reducing security risks, and employee knowledge of information security affects employee behavior in reducing security risks. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Data are widely used in an organization not only for operation but also for strategic level use. Poor data quality can have negative impact for an organization such as poor decision making and planning. Therefore, data quality management becomes an issue growing today not only to the academic but also professional communities. Based on this issue, this paper presents and analyzes a case study developed in a governmental agency, BPS-Statistics of Kaur Regency. For analysis, a data quality maturity model is used to measure the implementation of data quality management in the organization. The results show that for the dimension of 'Data quality expectations' is at a maturity of 4.25. 'Data quality protocol' is at a maturity of 3.50. 'Policies' reaches a maturity of 3.67. 'Data quality protocol' and 'Data standard' are at a maturity of 4.42. 'Data governance' is at a maturity of 3.00. 'Technology' is at a maturity 3.17. 'Performance management' is at a maturity of 3.33. However, this also implies that implementing these particular dimensions will lead to a direct increase in overall maturity. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the use of a new technology in the form of an online laboratory, it is necessary to analyze factors affecting behavioral intentions to use online laboratory services in the health field. The purpose of this study is to analyze Technology, Personal, and Environment (TPE) to the adoption of online laboratory services. The model used in this study incorporates the TPE model that measures the acceptance of technology at the individual level with the theory of technology acceptance behavior in terms of attitude and intention of online laboratory users in the health field. The model was tested with SEM-PLS modeling by using SmartPLS3 software. The respondents in this study are Indonesian people who have not used an online laboratory and who have used an online laboratory to check his health as many as 76 people. The results of identification on the respondents indicated that for personal, the risk factors that would be obtained by the public did not affect their intention to adopt an online laboratory system while the old habit or behavior of society using conventional laboratory methods and perceived cost factors affected their intention to use a new online laboratory system. Other than that, all environmental factors had a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness unless the facilitating condition had no significant effect on perceived ease of use. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: This study aims to develop a pedagogy which would help a school become a workplace for learning and professional development. Essentially, this objective addresses the following critical question. How can a school become an attractive workplace where learning and professional development of teachers positively contribute to better teaching and learning for the students? Design/methodology/approach: The research is considered as a case study. The pilot project or experiment has taken place at Mattayom Suwitserianusorn School which is part of Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. Design Thinking and Finnish practices have been explicitly integrated into peer-learning community (PLC). Design Thinking, through the use of empathy, helps highlight the interrelationships among motivation, emotion and cognition of students. Follow-up meetings provide insights into teacher’s professional development and impacts on student’s learning. The verification is based on award and recognition gathered over the past years for students and the school. Findings: PLC helps improve a school as a place for learning and professional development. The significance of integrating Design Thinking is extensively discussed. The project shows how co-teaching can be applied, given a proper selection of a problem. Higher motivation and better behavior among students are noticeable. The pilot project reinforces the importance of PLC in the current pedagogical development as it helps transform a school into workplace learning for both teachers and students. Blending Design Thinking helps strengthen the sustainability of PLC, as a lesson plan should be revised according to the students’ background and needs. Research limitations/implications: The study responds to the call by several international studies for better pedagogical development and in-service training for teachers’ continuous learning and professional development. More vigorous comparisons with other schools will be needed to help verify the study’s findings. This is due to the need to have a longitudinal study of PLC’s impacts. Practical implications: For teachers, an understanding of their common interests and the recognition on the need to learn from one another is important. For students, an understanding of their psychology and emotional intelligence through the use of Design Thinking is highlighted. Motivation, emotion and cognition of students are interrelated and can help transform a school into learning space. Originality/value: The study contributes to the transformation of a school as a workplace for learning and professional development which is based on the aforementioned pedagogical development. Also, Design Thinking helps strengthen PLC as an alternative pedagogical practices. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-petition, as a part of e-government application, has the potential to support citizens in voicing their aspiration to the government. E-petition has become an important part in e-participation implementation. It is widely used as an e-democracy tool. To be effective, e-petition should involve citizen participation. However, the absence of citizen initiatives has become an issue in developing e-petition. Besides, the current studies focus only on the developed country, where e-government has well-established. The case study of user-centered e-government in developing country is still under research. Therefore, this study aims to propose e-petition prototype by using User-Centered design (UCD) methodology in Indonesia. This paper has completed the users' in-depth interview and observation to analyze their needs and problems. As a result, this study has identified four main features that can emerge user to participate in e-petition, including a statistical diagram, push notification to the government, petition support organization and blog posting. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Master Data Management (MDM) empowers the organization to consolidate and integrate multiple master data sources into a single source of truth. Successful implementations of Master Data Management enable the organization to have standardized content that reflects business-based logic and rules processing. The goal of most MDM is to ensure that master data includes reference details that reflect the current state of the business. Master data management maturity model is a measurement of the ability of an organization for continuous improvement in master data management. The aim of this study is to measure MDM implemented in case organization with Master Data Management Maturity Model (MD3M). MD3M has five key topics and 13 focus areas. Those key topics and focus areas are designed to measure master data management maturity, each focus area has packed capabilities to be accomplished. The measurement showed that its maturity level is 0. Nevertheless, it not means that the organization did not implement MDM. The findings showed that almost 50% of the capabilities in MD3M had been implemented. By implementing further improvement about the missing capabilities, the organization will achieve higher maturity. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Now days, the home environment is still much less supportive of life for the elderly, most elderly living at home need a companion to help them. Safety, health, happiness and independence will be difficult for them to get even the elderly will be further away from the surrounding environment. Based on population projection 2017 data there are 23.66 million elderly people in Indonesia and predicted in 2020 there are 27.08 million people elderly. Smart homes that are currently widely studied have not focused on elderly; most smart homes only provide a sense of security and convenience for adult residents. And this will be a problem that until now has not solved the improvement of human life through technology to get happiness, care and health especially for the elderly. In many cases of the elderly, it is easier to send them to live in a nursing home and that keeps them separated from their families for the rest of their lives. That's what makes them less happiness. Orange Technology is a collection of technological elements to improve human life by getting happiness, Care and health. This study reviewed the journals of scientific databases such as IEEE explore, ACM digital library and Proquest published from 2002 to 2017. From the search results obtained 54 papers that will answer the scientific questions of this research. The result of this research is a framework of smart house that has Sensor, Monitoring, Wireless, Scalability, Low cost, GPS and ease of installation and maintenance as components of smart house of orange technology for elderly. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In natural language processing (NLP), measuring semantic similarity plays an important role. The results of these measurements are often used as the basis for performing natural language processing tasks such as question answering, document classification, machine translation, and so on. This paper analyses the test results using the latest dataset on the implementation of content management utilization on WordNet in the form of taxonomy in measuring semantic similarity values. Further implementation results are compared with Gold Standard datasets for measured performance. The dataset used for testing is SimLex-999. In performance measurement, Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation are used. The use of these two correlations because each correlation has several advantages and disadvantages. Based on the test results, Seco Formula resulted in Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation of 0.583 and 0.582 respectively. While New Formula resulted in Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation respectively of 0.602 and 0.594. The correlation results show strong positive correlation relationship. Therefore, the method of information content in WordNet is feasible to be used to measure the value of semantic similarity. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are the most often and most widely used social-media sites, especially in Indonesia. The number of social-media users is increasing every year, accompanied by increased risks. One of those risks is to the security and privacy of users, as shown by the user-data leak experienced by Facebook in 2018. These issues led the authors to conduct research relating to the influence of privacy concerns, trust, and user awareness on the readiness to share personal information via social-media sites. A research model was developed based on several hypotheses. The research model was confirmed, and experiment was conducted from 340 social-media users through a questionnaire-based online survey over a period of 2 months. To confirm the structural model used in this research, reliability and validity analyses were performed. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis was used to detect relationships among constructs in the research model. The results of this research show that user awareness, trust, and privacy concerns have a positive and significant effect on sharing personal data on social media. Then we discussed the implications of our results for policy-making, practice, and future research. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the implementation of Indonesia’s eGovernment, the presence of social media helps the government provide an information channel to the public, with great efficiency and low cost, and it stimulates participation from the public. In using social media as an information channel, the information quality (IQ) becomes one of the key factors affecting the level of user satisfaction. Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate the core dimensions that affect user satisfaction by using a case study from the Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu) and introducing the entropy method. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 173 participants between the users who followed Kemenkeu’s social media. The results show that completeness, novelty, and popularity are the core dimensions affecting user satisfaction. Then, by looking at the realities and expectations of the users, we made the mapping of the importance performance analysis (IPA) as a suggestion for the development strategy for Kemenkeu’s social media in improving their IQ. We found that the top dimensions for improvement strategy are the amount of appropriate information, ease of processing, and objectivity. This paper provides the groundwork to rank the IQ of social media, with a potential future research area. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to identify and analyze the key sub-factors of benefits and barriers as critical success factors for the implementation of IT Governance. The hope of the research is that the results of this identification and analysis can provide a high value of benefits in order to stakeholders in implementing IT Governance. In addition, it is expected to also give a real contribution to the development of theory or concept in the field of IT Governance especially related to critical success factor. The method used in this research is the interpretive structural model, where this method is very suitable to find the key sub-factor with a well-structured hierarchy structure. The first step of this research begins with a literature review, survey and interviews by involving three experts in the field of IT Governance and then the information is processed according to the rules. The final result shows that sub-factors improve customer service and overall responsiveness is a key sub-factor in benefit factors, whereas the lack of financial and human support becomes a key sub-factor in barriers. These results are empirical because depending on the data obtained through expert interviews involved, therefore the quality and capacity of experts greatly affect the results obtained. This study demonstrates how benefits and constraints as a critical success factor in the application of IT Governance are interrelated. The interpretive structural model provides an understanding of how various benefits and barriers interact with each other. This is important because policymakers typically focus on one or two sub-factors only. © 2019 Uky Yudatama, Achmad Nizar Hidayanto and Bobby A.A Nazief.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>There is a lack of studies concerning the maternal and neonatal referral system in troubled contexts, and the number of maternal and neonatal mortality deaths is considered high in developing countries. This study aims to understand the current conditions of the maternal and neonatal referral system in developing countries, in the context of barriers and technologies. We conducted a narrative literature review based on journals and conference papers in the last five years (2014–2018)from selected databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Direct, Scopus, Wiley Online, PMC, and ProQuest). The results of the study selection show that 40 studies identified barriers or challenges in maternal or neonatal referral systems, and eight studies discussed technology to support referral. Based on the results, barriers in maternal and neonatal referral systems can be divided into two main factors: 1. the healthcare system and 2. the patient. Some technologies are used in developing countries to support maternal and neonatal referral. However, these technologies still do not address all of the barriers described in the referral system. A study from different perspectives is needed, such as community involvement or government programs, to improve the current conditions of the maternal and neonatal referral system. © 2019</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to investigate the effect of gratification on the intention to repurchase digital items in digital games by extending the expectation-confirmation model in order to include the perceived value. Data obtained from 495 respondents were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) with the help of the SmartPLS 3.0 tool. The results of this study indicate that both enjoyment and customisation influence users' intention to repurchase digital items in digital games through satisfaction, while enjoyment, social presence, and social interaction influence users' intention to repurchase digital items in digital games through perceived value. Our results also demonstrate that both satisfaction and perceived value influence users' repurchase intention, which confirms the validity of our extension of the expectation-confirmation model. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to formulate a social media strategy framework that appropriate in government organisation that has a low interaction rate with public through their social media accounts. The research methods used was qualitative and quantitative on a government organisation which has already use social media however the utilisation was still low. The process of data collection was done by interview, observation and documents studies. The social media strategy was formulated using framework developed by Karl Werder combined with SWOT analysis, PEST analysis and 7S model. The strategy priority was determined by using AHP analysis. Three stages of social media framework formulation have been identified and the implementation results suggest that the organisation need to prioritise the strategies that have the objective to improve the complaint handling and then followed by the strategies related to engagement and awareness.

	<dc:abstract>The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) is a government institution that has the authority to carry out statistical activities in the form of censuses and surveys, to produce statistical data needed by the government, the private sector and the general public, as a reference in planning, monitoring, and evaluation of development results. Therefore, providing quality statistical data is very decisive because it will have an impact on the effectiveness of decision making. This paper aims to develop a framework to determine priority of solutions in overcoming data quality problems using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The framework is built by conducting interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) on experts to get the interrelationship between problems and solutions. The model that has been built is then tested in a case study, namely the Central Jakarta Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). The results of the study indicate that the proposed model can be used to formulate solutions to data problems in BPS. © University of Tehran, Faculty of Management</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>An integrated model of e-learning continuance intention in Indonesia</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>There had been some research concerning behaviour in using e-learning system. Most of the analysis focuses on the students' behavioural intention to use the system, without doing further analysis to find out their continuance intention to use it again. Therefore, this research aims to develop a model that describes the influencing factors on e-learning continuance intention of Indonesian students. Analysis in this research is focused on the investigations of the e-learning satisfaction, e-learning usefulness, and e-learning effectiveness, from the four main aspects: e-learning materials/multimedia, service quality, interaction, and learner's characteristics. By using Structural Equation Modelling approach, several analyses were conducted to 635 respondents' data, obtained from various university in Indonesia. This research found that almost all of the factors analysed in this research have a significant influence on continuance intention of Indonesian students, with e-learning satisfaction and e-learning usefulness as the main factors that influence directly, and navigation, reliability, tangibles, self-efficacy, and learner-content interaction as the main factors that influence indirectly. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

	<dc:abstract>Objectives: In this study an enterprise architecture (EA) was developed for a health referral information system (HRIS) for individual healthcare in Indonesia with reference to the Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) 9.1. The HRIS includes patient referrals for vertical and horizontal references (internal and external), specimen referrals, and health personnel referrals. Methods: This research was a qualitative study that used the interview and observation method of the Primary Health Care Information System (SIMPUS) application developed by the Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT). The interviews were conducted at South Tangerang City Government Health Office with five resource persons who were responsible for conducting health referral processes. Results: The EA of the HRIS includes the principles of architecture, business, application, data, and technology architecture. Twelve principles, four referral processes, and three application reference modules and centralized applications comprise the architecture of the HRIS. The HRIS is a centralized integrated application that uses application program interface (API) to integrate with SIMPUS. Conclusions: The proposed architecture was developed in an integrated and comprehensive manner for the individual healthcare referral process, which can be implemented by regulators and healthcare facilities. This architecture can also help regulators and healthcare facilities to standardize and integrate health referral data and related processes. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.</dc:abstract>

Information System on the Acquisition and Classification of Cervical Cancer Image (ISAC) is one of e-health built on the basis of research in the field of cervical cancer image. Before applying ISAC, we need to analyze to see the readiness of user acceptance and adaptation so that it can be implemented optimally. This study aims to prove the main factors affecting the user intention to use SIPK on the basis of a combined model of the theory of planned behavior and the technology acceptance. The model testing in this research was done by using SPSS software. The result of this research obtained the factors influencing user acceptance in using ISAC as well as recommendation as an effort for improvement. These factors are perceived service availability which significantly influenced perceived ease of use, perceived ease of use which significantly influenced perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use that significantly influenced attitude toward using technology, perceived usefulness that significantly influenced attitude toward using technology, and attitude toward using technology significantly influencing behavioral intention to use. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The single image classification of Pap smears is an important part of the early detection of cervical cancer through Pap smear tests. Unfortunately, most classification processes still require accuracy enhancement, especially to complete the classification in seven classes and to get a qualified classification process. In addition, attempts to improve the single image classification of Pap smears were performed to be able to distinguish normal and abnormal cells. This study proposes a better approach by providing different handling of the initial data preparation process in the form of the distribution for training data and testing data so that it resulted in a new model of Hierarchial Decision Approach (HDA) which has the higher learning rate and momentum values in the proposed new model. This study evaluated 20 different features in hierarchical decision approach model based on Neural Network (NN) and genetic algorithm method for single image classification of Pap smear which resulted in classification experiment using value learning rate of 0.3 and momentum of 0.2 and value of learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.5 by generating classification of 7 classes (Normal Intermediate, Normal Colummar, Mild (Light) Dyplasia, Moderate Dyplasia, Servere Dyplasia and Carcinoma In Situ) better. The accuracy value enhancemenet were also influenced by the application of Genetic Algorithm to feature selection. Thus, from the results of model testing, it can be concluded that the Hierarchical Decision Approach (HDA) method for Pap Smear image classification can be used as a reference for initial screening process to analyze Pap Smear image classification.

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: Mobile-based technology health services in Indonesia are experiencing significant growth. However, the implementation of m-health in Indonesia is at a stand-still because the numbers of users or medical personnel who use m-health applications are still low. Given this fact, this study aims to identify critical success factors (CSFs) in the implementation of a mobile health applications in Indonesia. This research covers the following four dimensions: system quality, information quality, service quality, and organizational. Method: This study uses a quantitative research approach with the entropy method to analyze system quality, information quality, and service quality, and it uses a qualitative approach for the organizational dimension. A total of 127 respondents completed the questionnaire (quantitative approach) and interviews were performed with three personnel from the Social Security Agency for Health (BPJS-K) (qualitative approach). Results: The highest weights for each dimension were as follows: ease of access for the system quality dimension; adequate and relevant information for the information quality dimension; user service convenience for the service quality dimension; and top management support for the organizational dimension. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the regulator, health facilities management, and mobile health provider should ensure a long-term commitment to support the implementation of mobile health applications. In order to reach a wider market, all mobile health applications should be as user friendly as possible for the patients. © 2018 The Authors</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedent of trust towards government-to-business (G2B) service in Indonesia. Trust will be viewed through four aspects, namely, cognition-based trust, personality-oriented trust, affect-based trust and experience–based trust. Then, these antecedents of trust were examined as the factors of continuance intention by extending the expected confirmation theory (ECT). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a quantitative approach, and 389 respondents were involved in the study. The respondents are the investors who represent their organization which uses e-government service to report their investment activities to the Investment Coordinating Board of Indonesia. Data were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modelling approach with WarpPLS 4.0. Findings: The result shows that factors that determine a user’s trust in government online service are service quality, trust towards government entity, recommendation to use the service and user’s habit of using the service. Factors that do not determine a user’s trust in government online service is a disposition to trust. Another finding is that a user’s trust on an online service does not directly influence his/her continuance of use. Trust will impact the continuance of use through perceptions of benefits and perceived satisfaction of using the online service. Research limitations/implications: ECT is applicable in G2B process. Organizations have a perception of benefit while using a public e-service and confirm the perception through their experience while using an e-service to gain satisfaction, and this will encourage them to continue using the service. Practical implications: To improve organizations’ trust on the e-service, the government needs to improve the e-service quality (by evaluating the efficiency, privacy, user support, reliability and information quality), investor familiarity of the system (training or socialization), investor trust on the government entity (improve the employee competence) and recommendation on using the system. Originality/value: Trust dimension has also been studied to be a factor that influences the intention or continuance of use of technology; however, it has rarely been studied towards its effect in the ECT’s context. In e-government study, there are various studies related to government-to-citizen (G2C) concept. However, the research in government-to-business (G2B) area that has not been explored much. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: This study aims to propose strategies to address the identified major barriers for giving the public open access to government data. The study adopts fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS) to weigh the barriers and strategies, and it subsequently involves experts to identify and weigh the barriers and strategies. A case of Indonesia is used to contextualize the study. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected using fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS-based questionnaires given to several government representatives who had been working with data and information. The respondents were given sets of pairwise comparisons of which they were asked to compare the level of importance using one to nine fuzzy numbers between barriers and strategies. The data were then calculated using the fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS formula to obtain each weight of the barriers and strategies. The weight is used to prioritize the barrier and strategies. Findings: In total, five barrier categories in the order of importance, namely, legal and privacy; government culture; social; technical; and economic, were identified from 27 barriers. In total, ten strategies of open government data (OGD) adoption were identified and ranked in the order of importance, and they can be grouped into five priorities. Priority 1 is to involve stakeholders in OGD planning and establish an OGD competence center. Priority 2 is to develop a legal compliance framework. Priority 3 is to adopt OGD gradually. Priority 4 is to create a collaboration feature on the portal for stakeholder communication and raise public awareness of OGD. Priority 5, finally, is to conduct training for government officials, develop standard operating practice for OGD management, use standard data formats and provide metadata. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a perspective from the government’s view. One suggestion for future research is to conduct a study from the public’s perspective to formulate strategies based on the identified citizens’ barriers in using OGD. In addition, cross-country (of different characteristics) studies were required to generalize the findings. Practical implications: The first strategy of the first priority implies that government institutions should be able to develop a preliminary plan to involve relevant stakeholders in OGD planning, which includes identifying relevant stakeholders and continuously engaging them to participate in the planning phase of OGD. The second strategy in the first priority entails that government institutions should realize an OGD competence center by creating a virtual team whose members are from various backgrounds and who are very knowledgeable about OGD and how to manage OGD in government institutions. Originality/value: This research provides key strategies to address the main barriers to giving the public open access to government data. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study reviews the literature on the most important acceptance factors associated with Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and related technologies based on user groups’ perspectives (medical staff, hospital management, administrative personnel, patient, medical student, and IT staff), which can assist researchers and hospital management to develop suitable acceptance models to improve the quality of HIS. We conducted searches in online databases with large repositories of academic studies, written in English and fully accessible by the authors. The articles being reviewed are related to health information technology (HIT), clinical information systems (CIS), HIS, electronic medical records (EMR), telemedicine or telehealth, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), radio frequency identification (RFID), and computerized physician order entry (CPOE), where the use of most of those applications and technologies is highly integrated. A predefined string was used to extract 1,005 articles, and the results were reviewed and checked. The results of this study found 15 user acceptance factors related to HIS and related technologies that were frequently identified by a minimum of five previous studies. These factors were related to individual, technological, and organizational factors. In addition, HIS and related technologies’ user acceptance factors in each user group describe different results. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Separation of overlapping areas on overlapping Pap smear image is still a tough thing to do. In addition to the process of identification of overlapping cells which is still difficult to do, sometimes there are components in the cells that complicate the process such as the presence of inflammatory cells that resemble the nucleus though the process of overlapping cell identification on Pap smear image is needed in early detection of Pap smear test to recognize a cell that is healthy or classified as cervical cancer cells. This study aims to segment the overlapping areas of Pap smear image by utilizing the color features of the cell. Stages of identification and separation of the area use K-means method combined with Otsu method. The results obtained in some cells of overlapping areas can be perfectly separated while in some other cells the results have not been encouraging and still require further research, especially to overcome the existence of inflammatory cells that complicate the separation process. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Simultaneous Multiple Rounds Auction (SMRA) and Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA) are two most dominant types of spectrum auctions in use today. CCA has potential to surpass SMRA as the standard for spectrum auctions. CCA's first practical implementations were the Trinidad and Tobago spectrum auction in 2005 and recently, Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada will held an auction for 600MHz licenses using CCA. New and improved auction format and rules emerged, led by advancement in auction theories and designs. The need of well understanding about CCA is a must in spectrum auction industry. CCA consist of Allocation Stage: Clock Rounds phase and Supplementary Round phase. This paper explain the road of CCA evolution and detailed focus in complexity in clock rounds phase. Two different activity-rules in clock rounds phase has been explain in this paper. We can conclude some of the future research in Combinatorial Clock Auction: the need of tools for clock rounds phase, the component tools to solve winner determination problem in supplementary round, and the pricing rule in CCA. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Customer satisfaction becomes a key influencer for people’s habits or daily activities. One of the examples is in the decision-making process about whether they will use specific products or services. People often need other’s review or rating about what they are going to use or consume. In this research, by using customer’s online review that available from Airbnb website, we try to extract what are the most talked factors about peer-to-peer accommodation, and how customer sentiment about them. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract that factors and conduct sentiment analysis by utilizing semantic analyzer from Google Cloud NLP. We analyze which factors that has more effect on customer satisfaction, not only in general but more specific based on customer gender and tourism destination object. The result shows that factors related to social benefit and service quality have impact on customer satisfaction, moreover different customer gender and different tourism object destination bring different sentiment among customer. We also find several factors that can be improved by the owner of the accommodation to improve customer satisfaction toward their services. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>ion-Person awareness is an important factor in maintaining information security, especially within an organization. To have such awareness, support from management is essential to protect the company's assets from external threats. This study is conducted to evaluate the security awareness of employees in The Directorate General of Resources Management and Postal and Information Technology Equipment (SDPPI) of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo). The study was conducted by performing structured interviews with senior management and distributing questionnaires to 28 employees of SDPPI related to security awareness. The information security awareness level assessment is calculated using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The results show that the level of information security awareness of the SDPPI Kominfo is in the 'medium' level. Employees have low scores in some sub areas of information security awareness dimensions, thus it is required to make certain strategies in terms of business, technology and people to monitor and improve the level of information security awareness of employees. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to find the factors and sub-factors important in awareness IT Governance. This is necessary because it has a major influence on the successful implementation of IT Governance within an organization. The data were collected through interviews with 3 competent experts in the field of IT Governance, the best data suitability that has been obtained from these experts, then considered and to be processed using Interpretive Structural Model (ISM). This method is considered very effective to obtain the hierarchical structure and the relationship between each factor and sub-factor. The final results of this study obtained some important factors and sub-factors in awareness of IT Governance among others: benefits, risk reduction, opportunities, and obstacles. Of the four factors are divided into 14 sub-factors, and from the result analysis by using ISM obtained: (a) differences in viewpoint about business and IT objectives; (b) the ownership of data that is still tied between sections and (c) lack of technical knowledge, these three are important sub-factors (sub-factors key) that may affect success in the implementation of IT Governance, therefore these sub-factors need to get serious attention for the implementation of IT Governance can run well so as to improve the quality and performance of the organization in the future. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>It is important for tourism online marketplace to ensure potential tourists continually use their services as an alternative to find and purchase travel packages. Hence, the factors that influence customers' negative behaviors, such as switching intention, complaints, and negative WOM are critical to be understood. This research explores the antecedents of tourist customers' negative behaviors, using expectancy disconfirmation theory (EDT) as its theoretical lens, and IS success model as the initial quality precursors. The research gathered 81 sample, whom were active users of a tourism eMarketplace from the greater Jakarta region. The quantitative data was then analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results showed that quality disconfirmation served as a key antecedent of customers' negative emotions, which in turn will lead to their negative behaviors. More specifically, disconfirmation in information quality may prompt customers' regret, which then leads to negative WOM. Finally, systems quality disconfirmation triggers customers' anger, which then elicits a number of negative behaviors such as switching intention, complaints and negative WOM. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to investigate factors that affect users' intention to adopt Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) technology in Indonesia. HCI is an infrastructure that is based on software-centric architecture combines with integrated computing, storage, virtualization and other technologies packed in one box supported by one vendor. The adoption of this technology is still low both in the world and in Indonesia. This research integrates three frameworks, namely the Task-Technology Fit (TTF), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Technology, Organization and Environment (TOE). Data from 113 respondents are analyzed using SmartPLS software, a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) tool. This study found that perceived ease of use, competitive pressure, and vendor support affect users' intention to use Hyper-Converged Infrastructure technology. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

This article distinguishes itself by differentiating the roles of platform providers and those of merchants in identifying the determinants that affect repurchase intention in c2c e-commerce. Data in this article was collected from the users of a respected c2c e-commerce company in Indonesia. A total of 347 sample was analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS), a variance based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) aided by SmartPLS 2.0 software. The results of this article showed that satisfaction with merchants and trust in platform providers were factors that directly affected repurchase intention. Meanwhile, perceived quality of merchants, perceived quality of platform providers, perceived value, and trust in merchants were factors that affected repurchase intention indirectly.

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to investigate the influence of technological, personal, and environmental factors on users' intention to adopt mobile payment from the perspective of Indonesian consumers. We conducted an online survey, which obtained 1684 valid respondents. Those data were analyzed using SEM method with AMOS 21.0 application. This study showed that intrinsic motivation and facilitating condition significantly have a positive effect on consumer's perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Then, personal innovativeness only showed to have a significant effect on perceived ease of use, while social influence only showed to have a significant effect on perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease of use also showed to have a significant effect on perceived usefulness. Lastly, both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use proved to have a significant impact on consumers' intention to use mobile payment thus confirming the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model in the mobile payment acceptance context. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>There is urgency for public agencies in Indonesia, including Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemdikbud), to provide high quality of information services. However, the absence of social media strategy is alleged to be the root of the problem related to citizen satisfaction and has serious impact on effectiveness of the planning process, especially for management to prioritize important programs and actions. By using action research methodology, this study aims to formulate social media management strategies for Kemdikbud to increase public satisfaction toward provided information services. Further, the formulated strategy will be followed up by the formulation ofperformance indicators, so as to easily measure the success rate of the implementation of social media strategies. We incorporated SWOT Analysis and Third Wave framework as the main references to formulate social media management strategies, people strategies, content strategies, and platform strategies. Direct observation techniques, document analysis, and interviews were conducted for SWOT analysis of social media management and identifying the characteristics of the people, content and social media platforms of Kemdikbud. At the end, this study successfully identifies and formulates six social media management strategies, one people-related strategy, four content-related strategies, and one platform-related strategy. In addition, there are eight performance indicators that can be adopted by Kemdikbud to measure the implementation of formulated social media strategies. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purpose of this research is to understand the antecedents of continuance usage intention and intention to recommend of information based mobile application. The underlying research model was developed from technological as well as user experience perspectives, intertwined with the expectation-confirmation model. A total of 176 respondents participated in this study, whom were avid users of a respected information based mobile application in Indonesia. Data was analyzed using Structural Equational Modeling, aided by WarpPLS 4.0. The results revealed a number of factors that influence intention to reuse and intention to recommend, which include system quality, information quality, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, confirmation, and satisfaction. Perceived usefulness and satisfaction were factors that directly affect continuance usage intention. Intention to recommend, on the other hand, was only directly influenced by satisfaction. Confirmation affected both user experience factors of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, as well as satisfaction. Finally, perceived usefulness was affected by information quality and perceived enjoyment was affected by system quality. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Although many countries have developed e-participation system, their citizen's participation levels are still not good. Thus, this paper aims to further explore the drivers behind citizen's decision to engage in participation on the internet, by validating the use of Social Cognitive Theory and combining it with E-government Service Quality theory as its environment factor. Research data are gathered from 410 respondents by using survey method analyzed with Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results show that the most significant factor behind citizen's intention to participate online is participation self efficacy. Furthermore, outcome expectation performance and personal are also proven to be one of drivers. Meanwhile, those cognitive factors (participation self-efficacy and outcome expectations) are positively affected by service quality of e-government. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Today, more and more countries in the world are opening their data to public. As more government data are freely accessible, a question that arises is whether all published data meet the principle of open data. This study aims to evaluate open data implementation on the official government websites in Indonesia, especially at the ministerial level. The observation aimed to assess the level of data openness based on open data principles. This evaluation was conducted using Data Openness Index (DOT). The results showed that out of five levels of data openness index (level 0 to 4), the data openness of ministries websites in Indonesian is at the third level (Average Openness). The analysis of this study suggests that each indicator of DOI need to be considered so that published data are not only available but can also be further utilized to enhance transparency, social and commercial values, and more participatory governance. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The ample of overlapping cells that complicate the slides reading and interpretation by pathologists has become a problem encountered in the conventional retrieval result. Another delicate problem is determining and analyzing the nucleus in the Pap smear of microcospic cells with inflammatory. A method for detecting overlapping cells and reducing the inflammatory cells to facilitate cell identification is required to solve the problems of overlapping cells and inflammatory cells. The proposed method is based on the fact that in isolated cells, the cell nucleus is located in the center of the surrounding cytoplasm. The first phase of the proposed method is the segmentation of the overlapping cells which consists of overlapping cytoplasm segmentation and overlapped area segmentation. The second phase of the proposed method is the overlapping cell separation and the last phase is the inflammatory cells ellimination and nucleus detection. The method has been evaluated on single cell images of conventional Pap smears, and the results are very promising. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Research on handwriting recognition using deep learning method has been widely explore by many researchers in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Many researchers mentioned that handwriting recognition using deep learning technique has lead to achieve higher accuracy compared to conventional machine learning techniques. Handwriting character recognition using deep learning has been impalement in Latin, Chinese, Arabic, Persian, and Bangla Character. As for the object of Javanese character is still not much encroached. Since the Javanese Classical Manuscripts contain a variety of scientific treasures that can be taken up in order to be preserved as a valuable heritage possessed from Indonesia. Therefore, in this study, the Javanese character Recognition is applied using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is one type of discriminative deep-learning model that is widely used for classification based on supervised learning. CNN method is a very powerful deep learning technique in completing its task to perform data classification with image dataset as an input, because it utilizes pixel neighbor information in feature extraction process with convolution and pooling operation between inputs and kernel. The data than classify using softmax to determine its class based on its features. From the experimental results obtained that the discriminative model of deep learning has confirmed to recognize 20 basic Javanese character with the accuracy 94.57 %. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Detection and identification of cells in a Pap smear test is very important for determining cell abnormalities. Detection of cells becomes an important stage in early detection of cervical cancer. The presence of inflammatory cells in Pap smear images often results in the identification of nuclei in the early detection of cervical cancer in Pap smear image becomes difficult to do. The success of inflaming the inflammatory cells and detecting the nucleus will facilitate the process of identifying the nucleus. This will greatly help the development of information acquisition system technology and the classification of single Pap smear cell image for early detection of cervical cancer. The paper aims to compare three methods of nuclear detection and inflammatory cell in a single Pap smear image. The results of the comparison of nucleus and inflammatory cell in the test of data consisting of 84 images with inflammatory cells, showed that the K-Means and Bayesian classification method has not been able to accurately detect the nuclei and inflammatory cell, rather than the nuclei and inflammatory cells detection base on the combination of gray level thresholding method. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study uses the extended Expectation Confirmation Model by adding a "new" variable, the users' perceived enjoyment into the model. The model is employed to identify intrinsic factors which affect users' continuance intention of mobile banking. Furthermore, this study attempts to examine whether the users' perceived enjoyment together with the intrinsic factors influence the continuance intention. There are two factors which are tested in this study: self-efficacy and familiarity. As much as 343 respondents participate in this study. Data from the respondents then analyzed by using the partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) method with SmartPLS 3.0 as the software. This study finds that self-efficacy and familiarity give impacts on users' expectation confirmation and users' perceived enjoyment which lead to a higher users' continuance intention towards mobile banking application. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The implementation of e-participation in Indonesia nowadays increases along with the rise of e-government. But, participation level in Indonesia is still lack behind other countries. Thus, it is needed to analyze factors influencing citizen's intention to participate electronically. This study examines factors influencing citizen to participate in e-participation service with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and Technology Readiness theory. The case study used in this study is LAPOR!, an online public aspiration system in Indonesia. Furthermore, this study is written to validate the use of SCT and extend it with technology readiness theory as technology adoption rate in developing country is not spread evenly. Research data is collected from 410 respondents and analyzed with Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The empirical outcomes indicate two cognitive factors of SCT (participation self efficacy and outcome expectation personal) have significant impact towards intention to participate. Meanwhile, citizen's technology readiness implies their cognitive, in which influencing their intention to participate. Moreover, the result of this study helps government to improve and maximize e-participation potential so that government transparency can be achieved. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The use of RFID based baggage handling system has widely spread all over the world. This brings a successfully decreasing in the amount of baggage mishandling. SITA 2017 reported that during 10 years until 2016 there is increasing of airline passengers, but decreasing in the amount of mishandled baggage. Many people believe that this great achievement was caused by IT implementation in baggage handling system in airport, including the massive use of RFID for baggage identification tool. Indonesia as one of the countries with the largest population had a significant increasing amount of air passengers and their baggage, that is 15% from 2015 to 2016. Until now this huge number of air baggage is stil manually handled, so Indonesia is facing a serious problem of handling the huge amount of baggage that keep growing. This paper is a preliminary literature study to iniate the development of RFID based baggage handling system in Indonesia. The research question is what is design considerations to develop RFID based baggage handling system. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The development of electronic learning models, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia has grown well as information technology applications designed for learning purposes. Community colleges and schools seek to complement the traditional teaching system with e-learning systems. However, we found there are differences in individual learning styles in terms of speed and learning styles. Serving or teaching students with one mechanism of the same teaching method will ignore individual rights while reducing the meaning of education broadly from the humanity dimension. Such situations will affect the target of increasing competence, the growth of knowledge and the value expected for some individuals to fail. The electronic learning model then undergoes a shift away from a mere system, now evolving into a personalized learning model, where learning processes are oriented toward the students' abilities. Under these conditions, models and other techniques are needed to help personalized adaptive learning as they need it. The purpose of this study was to identify the general criteria of personalized electronic learning model to meet the needs, interests and objectives of the learner in a more personal sense in a broader sense. This research was conducted through literature study on papers published in the last five years (2012-2017). The results show the common components, techniques or tools that are commonly used, as well as the support of the theoretical basis used as the platform for the development of a personalized e-learning model. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A gap between university graduate's quality and industry sector demand is one of the challenge university has to tackle, which makes university graduates absorption in job market slows down. One of the tools that can be used to bridge between graduates and companies is an integrated career portal. This portal can be optimized to help industry find the employees they need from the alumni from university. On the other hand, this tool can help graduates to get job that suits their competency. By using the portal, alumni can hopefully minimize the number of unemployed university graduates and accelerate their absorption into job market. The development of this career portal will use agile methodology. Questionnaire was distributed to alumni and employers to collect information about what user need in the portal. The result of this research can create a career portal which integrated business process and social media. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aimed to identify and rank user acceptance factors regarding the implementation of hospital information systems (HIS) based on the views of the following user groups: doctors, nurses, hospital management, and administrative staff (operators). The results should provide guidance for hospital management and HIS developers on meeting user requirements. The study was carried out using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The authors conducted interviews and distributed questionnaires to doctors, nurses, hospital management, and administrative staff in a government-owned Indonesian public hospital. Entropy measurements were used to analyze the questionnaire data. The study identified 15 important HIS user acceptance factors, which were ranked differently by each user group. The results show that non-technological dimensions, such as human and organizational dimensions, influence HIS user acceptance to a greater extent than technological dimensions. More work should be carried out to gain a better understanding of the relationship between user acceptance factors in order to increase the success of HIS implementations. © 2017 Taylor &amp; Francis.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is an integrated information system to manage a company's business processes. Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) needs ERP but lack the funds necessary. Open Source System ERP (OSS ERP) becomes the choice for applying ERP by SMEs for the price and customizability. This research aims to identify the characteristics and configuration of e-commerce module OSS ERP at KKPS (Koperasi Karyawan PT SRI) using OSS ERP Odoo. Sales Section is the most important part in Employees Cooperation PT Suryaraya Rubberindo Industries (KKPS). Most of the turnover is generated from the sales process. Currently the sales process is still done manually and the procurement of goods has not been computerized, thus causing delays in data transmission from one part to another. To improve the sales process in KKPS, a system that supports the integration of each part is needed. Data integration with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation is expected to help the sales process to be more efficient. The selected ERP system is Odoo, as it is an open source ERP application that has various business application programs. Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is used to create business process analysis and modeling so that KKPS performance can be improved. Simulated purchase of goods is done to ensure the Odoo Website and E-commerce module runs well. After the implementation of Odoo Website and E-commerce module on KKPS, information on KKPS is more accessible to its members. The purchase of products or services through KKPS can be done more easily through e-commerce. © IEOM Society International.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An effective knowledge transfer (KT) process is a key factor in achieving the competitive advantage that is critical for software development companies seeking to maintain their existence and improve their performance. However, there do exist obstacles to the achievement of effective knowledge transfer. Companies often face difficulties in identifying those barriers that have the great impact on KT as well as the best solutions with which to address them. Through a systematic literature review and interviews conducted with 15 experts, we identified 21 KT barriers and 12 KT solutions. The barriers were classified into three categories: team, project, and technology. Then, using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, the identified KT barriers and solutions were ranked. The result of this research is a list of ranked KT barriers and solutions relevant to software development. Poor communication and interpersonal skills, lack of management direction, and challenges to transactive memory systems topped the list of team-, project-, and technology-related barriers, respectively. It was further found that an additional weekly meeting is the best solution with which to overcome the barriers to KT. © 2018 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

	<dc:abstract>In an effort to fight corruption, the Indonesian government has put eprocurement as one of the strategic programs among the seven flagships of the National Information Technology Council (DETIKNAS). One very successful developer of an e-procurement system is the Public Procurement Policy Institution, or Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah (LKPP), with 731 government agencies and 333,452 suppliers accessing LKPP's system. This study was conducted to analyse the determinants of an e-procurement system's success as well as its impact on perceived transparency from the supplier's perspective. This study answers both questions by applying a covariance-based structural equation modelling approach to analyse the survey data of 157 respondents. This study finds that only system quality, service quality, regulation, trust, user satisfaction, and perceived benefits determine an e-procurement system's success. However, only trust in an e-procurement system predominantly affects perceived transparency. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Herlev dataset consists of 7 cervical cell classes, i.e. superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ is considered. The dataset will be tested to classify two classes, consisting of normal and abnormal cells. Seven different cell types will be classified to separate the cells into 7 classes which are 3 normal cell classes and 4 abnormal cell classes. There are still some difficulties to classify the dataset into seven classes. This Pap smear image dataset has a class with a number of different and unbalanced classes. Another condition is that the data has features that are suspected to be irrelevant, so it is still difficult to classify especially abnormal classes. To handle the class imbalance, this study used ensemble method (Bagging). For handling data that had features and had no contribution, we made feature selection of Greedy Forward Selection. Furthermore, Naïve Bayes was used as learning algorithms. The results of this study obtained the highest accuracy value for the classification of two classes that are normal and abnormal using Naïve Bayes model with Greedy Forward Selection of 92.15%. As the classification of seven classes is good enough for Naïve Bayes model and Greedy Forward Selection with Bagging of 63.25% although it still needs to improve. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to examine the determinants of customers’ intention to engage in online group buying, which involves electronic word of mouth, information searching, trust in the vendor, trust in the product, monetary value, hedonic value, and utilitarian value. The research model was analyzed using partial least squares of 196 respondents who had previously completed an online group buying transaction. The data were processed using SmartPLS 2.0 M3 software. The study found that electronic word of mouth significantly influenced information searching and trust (in both the vendor and the product). Further, information searching only significantly influenced trust in the product, although it had a strong correlation with all the types of perceived value (monetary value, hedonic value, and utilitarian value). In conclusion, we believe that trust in the vendor, monetary value, and hedonic value have a significant impact on customers’ intention to engage in online group buying in Indonesia. © 2017 Universidad de Talca – Chile.</dc:abstract>

The use of social CRM in the higher education industry lags behind many other industries primarily because social CRM models do not exist for higher education. This research aims to provide the critical success factors for implementing a social CRM system for higher education institutions in Jakarta, Indonesia. A questionnaire was sent to fifty eight private universities in Jakarta. Each questionnaire had one hundred thirteen questions which were sent to top level higher education officials in order to understand the critical success factors needed to build a social CRM model. Seventeen universities replied and sixteen critical success factors were identified as core components after performing a statistical technique named Principle Component Analysis (PCA). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to examine in more depth about how, why awareness and attitudes towards the implementation of IT governance is very important, so it can affect the performance of an organization or company. The methods used in this study began with literature review and interviews with some experts in their field, 4 from academics and 2 practitioners. To strengthen this research, we have distributed 100 questionnaires, but 96 respondents actively provided feedback, then analyzed and validated using a correlation test (r). To understand awareness and attitudes towards IT Governance, there are several factors that can be used. As for factors such as; Benefits, risks, opportunities and obstacles. These factors are very important and relate entirely with awareness and attitudes. By knowing these factors, all parties involved in IT Governance become easy to understand, then awareness and attitude will grow from itself, so as to improve performance and ultimately organizational goals can be achieved optimally as expected. The results obtained from this research indicate that the benefit factor and opportunity factor have more value, while the risk factor and constraint factor is smaller. In order for the implementation of IT Governance to run properly, it is necessary to be encouraged in understanding the knowledge and knowing the implementation of IT Governance that is being implemented. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Online review is becoming more popular among the public when considering the purchase of a product or service. This also applies in tourism industry when potential tourists were making decisions about travel destination. This research aims to identify online review elements/features that will affect readers' intention to travel. Hence, the model was designed by categorized online review characteristics namely system, information and informant characteristic. These characteristics then influence perceived informativeness, destination image and informant expertise and trustworthiness viewed in reader viewpoint and eventually affect reader intention to travel. Analysis of the model was conducted by using PLS SEM with 189 valid questionnaires. The result of this study proved that some elements/features of online review influence reader intention to travel. They are quality and quantity of the reviews and destination indicator which are available on the website. However, this study suggest that current features are not sufficient to explain reviewer credibility, thus other features need to be added to the website to serve this purpose. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>To guarantee the quality of service towards citizens, government agencies have performed the implementation of Service Level Agreement (SLA) in their e-Government services. The fact in some countries applying SLA showed that there was an increase in the quality of service. In Indonesia, however, the implementation of SLA on e-Government (G2C) services is still relatively low, thus this study aims to determine the inhibiting factors in the adoption of SLA in Indonesia using DEMATEL model. Nine initial inhibiting factors were obtained from the literature review. Then, questionnaires based on DEMATEL model were designed and distributed to each echelon 2 unit that manages e-government in 32 government institutions. Ten institutions filled and returned the questionnaires. The results showed the lack of leadership support is the prime inhibiting factor in the adoption of SLA in Indonesia. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Over the past three years, we have tracked the rising adoption of Web 2.0 technologies, both for individual and organizational. Enterprises believe Web 2.0 will provide new ways for interacting with their consumers, which is more convenient, easier, and cheaper. Social CRM becomes new concept and strategy for enterprises in utilizing Web 2.0 technologies to interact with and listen to their customers through social media. Although Social CRM offers more benefits, it might have side impact for the enterprises. Thus, the adoption of Social CRM still needs profound evaluation in order to minimize the adverse impact. This study aims to investigate critical factors of Social CRM adoption using TOE (technology, organization, and environment) framework and AHP technique. The case studies were carried out into two companies. The result shows critical factors of CRM adoption for Company 1 come from external factors; they are prioritizing customer, trustworthy information, and customer characteristics. Meanwhile, critical factors of CRM adoption for Company 2 come from internal factors; they are savvy employee, top management support, and customer-oriented business strategy. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a model of Hospital Information System (HIS) user acceptance focusing on human, technological, and organizational characteristics for supporting government eHealth programs. This model was then tested to see which hospital type in Indonesia would benefit from the model to resolve problems related to HIS user acceptance. Method This study used qualitative and quantitative approaches with case studies at four privately owned hospitals and three government-owned hospitals, which are general hospitals in Indonesia. The respondents involved in this study are low-level and mid-level hospital management officers, doctors, nurses, and administrative staff who work at medical record, inpatient, outpatient, emergency, pharmacy, and information technology units. Data was processed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and AMOS 21.0. Results The study concludes that non-technological factors, such as human characteristics (i.e. compatibility, information security expectancy, and self-efficacy), and organizational characteristics (i.e. management support, facilitating conditions, and user involvement) which have level of significance of p &lt; 0.05, significantly influenced users’ opinions of both the ease of use and the benefits of the HIS. This study found that different factors may affect the acceptance of each user in each type of hospital regarding the use of HIS. Finally, this model is best suited for government-owned hospitals. Conclusions Based on the results of this study, hospital management and IT developers should have more understanding on the non-technological factors to better plan for HIS implementation. Support from management is critical to the sustainability of HIS implementation to ensure HIS is easy to use and provides benefits to the users as well as hospitals. Finally, this study could assist hospital management and IT developers, as well as researchers, to understand the obstacles faced by hospitals in implementing HIS. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The objective of this research is to investigate the benefit of utilizing hashtags to determine sentiment polarity of tweets in the political domain. We used the sentiment polarity of hashtags as the features in classification, proposed rules for automatically annotating dataset based on the number of positive and negative hashtags in the tweets, and proposed a method to enrich terms in the tweet by extracting hashtag terms. We named the number of positive and negative hashtags as SentiHT feature. The experiments and evaluation show that sentiment classification using SentiHT feature and the automatically labeled dataset using SentiHT has a very good accuracy of more than 95%. Moreover, SentiHT outperforms unigram feature when combined with Naïve Bayes, SVM or Logistic Regression algorithms, but the opposite occurs when using Random Forest algorithm. Based on computing time to build the model, we recommend using SentiHT feature combined with Naïve Bayes algorithm. © 2017 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Human resources are the most important asset of the organizations, therefore the management of human resources are needed to improve organizations performance. Organizations need an information system, known as the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) to make the process of managing employees become more effective and efficient. The change of organizations' needs, make the information system is also changing. The resistance of employees to accept the changes of the new information system is a problem that can not be avoided. The purpose of this research is to identify factors that influence user acceptance of HRIS system. The research model builds by integrating UTAUT, TTF, and Symbolic Adoption model. The research data obtained by distributing 156 questionnaires to HRIS users in one of the coal mining companies. The results of this study indicate that Task Technology Fit and Social Influence are factors that influence users acceptance in using HRIS. This study also proves that Task Technology Fit is influenced by Task Characteristics and Technology Characteristics. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge Management has been identified as an important discipline and strategy to transform government agencies into effective public sector organizations. One important role of KM in the organization is to help organizations become more effective. Unfortunately, there are many failures in KM implementation. Many researches established that assessing KM readiness in the organization improve the likelihood of KM implementation success. This study intends to develop a framework that can be used to measure KM readiness of an organization using AHP method. The data collection for the development of the framework is done through literature studies, mapping the knowledge management critical success factors (KMCSF), and focus group discussion among the experts. The results provide the conclusion that there are twelve (12) factors with their respective weights. These indicators can be used as an indicator for measuring knowledge management readiness level. The framework successfully implemented as a case study on Environmental and Pollution Control Deputy, Ministry of Environment. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A study conducted by The Standish Group in 2012 categorised only 39% of worldwide software development projects were successful while 43% were challenged and 18% were failed. This study aims to analyse critical success factors (CSFs) of software development projects in Indonesia in order to increase the likelihood for projects' success. We initially conducted systematic literature review to identify the CSFs. These CSFs were then evaluated by three experts and the result was given as the input to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) tool namely the expert choice to yield a ranking. The AHP involved 23 experts in software development projects from Project Management Institute of Indonesia. This study found that business goal fulfilment is the most critical criterion while project management is the most critical category. Thus, considering both criteria and category, AHP primarily recommend scope management. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper was aimed to understand the antecedents of CAATT adoption by external auditors in public accounting firms. The underlying research model was adapted from Technology Adoption Model (TAM) with the inclusion of external variables. A total of eleven factors were tested as determinants of CAATT's acceptance. A total of 141 sample data were gathered from various public accounting firms who avidly use CAATT in the greater Jakarta region. The data was then analyzed statistically using Partial Least Square (PLS) Structural Equational Modeling (SEM) techniques. The results provided empirical evidences than CAATT adoption was directly influenced by behavioral intention, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. External variables that were deemed as antecedents of perceived usefulness include output quality and result demonstrability. Finally, perceived ease of use was influenced by technological complexity and computer self-efficacy. © 2018 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: This paper aims to answer a major challenge in the success of electronic government (e-government) implementation, viz., public participation via continual use intention and electronic word-of-mouth (eWoM). This study tries to provide some control by examining the impact of e-government quality on public trust and with continual use intention and eWoM. This study adopts the eminent information systems (IS) success model and expands the trust dimension into a multi-dimensional trust. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using questionnaires distributed among e-government service users in Indonesia. In total, 293 respondents were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Of the three IS success factors, namely, systems quality, information quality and service quality, the former two are found to have significant correlation with trust. Dispositional trust has a substantial relationship with institutional trust and interpersonal trust, whereas institutional trust has a significant correlation with interpersonal trust. Institutional trust exhibits direct relationship with continual use intention and eWoM, whereas interpersonal trust has a significantly correlation with only continual use intention. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests that it is plausible that user satisfaction could act as an intermediary between service quality and trust or between service quality and continual use intention. Thus, further research studies to examine satisfaction factor and its correlation with public acceptance are encouraged. Practical implications: Government agencies should focus on information quality and systems quality which have a significant relation with trust development. These should be more thorough and meticulous to provide complete, secure and easy-to-use e-government information. These should also facilitate eWoM because it plays an important role in disseminating e-government (services). Originality/value: This research provides a deeper and more accurate grasp on how public participation of e-government can be improved via trust. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Audit is a form of e-government that is utilised by the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia (BPK-RI) to assist the state,s financial auditors. However, when conducting audit not all auditors use the e-Audit. This study was conducted to determine factors that affect auditors in using e-Audit by combining theoretical models from the technology acceptance model (TAM), the innovation diffusion theory (IDT), the DeLone and Mclean information systems success model, with individual dimensions on the technology readiness index (TRI) and variable of management support. From the questionnaires that were distributed and collected from BPK RI,s ministries, and agencies, auditors, we obtained 185 samples. The data were then analysed using partial least squares on structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that quality system of e-Audit, compatibility e-Audit with the audit process, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, have positive influence either directly or indirectly on the auditor,s intention to use e-Audit. While the auditor,s discomfort feeling on new technologies will have a negative effect indirectly on the auditor,s intention to use e-Audit.

	<dc:abstract>Balancing economic and environmental activities is an important issue for organisations. Green IT has emerged as a solution towards the problem. This research attempts to measure the maturity of green IT in organisations in Indonesia based on the G-readiness model and also to identify drivers of and inhibitors to its implementation. Then, it tries to identify strategy for organisation and government to enhance green IT adoption. This was done by conducting a questionnaire survey to IT workers from various companies in Indonesia. The results show the maturity is at medium level and that it focuses on energy consumption efficiency. Furthermore, economic factors, such as improving brand image and reducing operational cost of IT function, are identified as main drivers. In addition, internal factor, namely, lack of leadership was found to be the main inhibitor. Additionally, it is also revealed that government support in the form of incentives and regulations are necessary. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The study aims to confirm the key elements for an enterprise's performance in the areas of sustainability. These elements (anticipation, concern, leadership, communication, capability, planning, execution, performance and report) have been earlier derived from the previous study which is based on the literature reviews and the interviews with the researchers and practitioners from Thailand and Finland. The focus-group and survey approaches are applied for this confirmation or verification. For the focusgroup approach, there were altogether 30 participants while there were 504 enterprises completed the questionnaire. After analysing the results with the criteria, the nine key elements are deemed to reflect the term sustainability. They provide the premise for an enterprise to consider when attempting to deal with the term sustainability. Sustainability has been viewed as the next step to ensure long-term business competitiveness for an enterprise after productivity and quality, environment, occupational safety and health, and corporate social responsibility.

	<dc:abstract>Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) has been well-known as a standard of Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) implementation in organizations. Even though, organizations require much resources in the application of ITIL, the implementation number is still increasing per-year. This study attempts to explore and explain the Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and Risks (BOCR) of the ITIL implementation. A deep literature review is conducted to produce the current understanding of ITIL implementation in term of those four aspects of BOCR. Those initial findings are classified by using Balanced Scorecard (BSC) perspective and then be validated by employing interviews with seven IT experts who involved directly in ITIL implementation in their organizations. This study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects. Fifty six BOCR factors are successfully validated. Furthermore, twelve of those factors are newly identified in this study. Those validated factors may be used by organizations as a future guidance in implementing ITIL in their organization. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aimed to examine the influence of knowledge management system (KMS) quality on users' continuance intention. The research model was developed by integrating the concept of DeLone and McLean's information systems (IS) success model with the expectation confirmation model. To examine the developed model, a survey was conducted with 131 respondents from three companies that had implemented a KMS. The data were analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) method. The study demonstrated that both system quality and information/knowledge quality influence all the factors that drive the continuance intention regarding KMS usage, namely perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and trust. Moreover, satisfaction proved to have an impact on users' recommendation intention concerning the KMS. Therefore, companies should improve the KMS quality in order to drive employees to continuously use the KMS and recommend it to others.</dc:abstract>

The result of this research showed that CoP proved to provide benefits for individuals and to the community as well as the organisation indirectly. Moreover, types of participation that provides most benefits to performance are work barrier discussion, followed by success story discussion. However, career development discussion has not been proven to give benefit to organisation. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purposes of this research are to identify software as a service (SaaS) quality factors and to utilise these factors in developing a framework to evaluate the SaaS service quality given by the SaaS providers. The framework is developed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and involving ten respondents with 4-18 years experiences in SaaS field. The result of the process shows that there are 32 factors that influence the SaaS quality. These factors consist of 15 factors related to product, ten factors related to process and seven factors related to organisation. The highest priorities of each group are factors related to security, quality control, and technically competent employee for product, process, and organisation group, respectively. We also demonstrate the application of the SaaS service quality factors framework to evaluate the SaaS service quality in one of the SaaS-based human resource management application vendor.

	<dc:abstract>The study develops the sustainability performance model which is based on learning from the viewpoints of the executives and practitioners. Further, it seeks to empirically test the causal relationships among the elements affecting the performance relating to enterprise sustainability. Using a sample of 504 respondents from manufacturing sectors found within Thailand, results of both confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) indicate that all of the hypothesised causal relationships within the purposed model are statistically significant. Measurements were developed, tested, and found to be both valid and reliable. The structural equation modelling technique was used to assess the validity of the measurement models and the structural models with a single test. Leadership was subsequently identified as a major driver for planning, communication, and capability and strongly supported anticipation and concern, which were shown to be elements that indirectly influence execution, performance, and report. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Hospital Information System (HIS) could help hospitals as a public entity to provide optimal health services. One of the main challenges of HIS implementation is an institutional change. Using institutional theory as the analytical lens, this study aims to explain the institutionalization of HIS as an instance of e-health initiatives in Indonesia. Furthermore, this paper aims for hospital management and researchers to improve the understanding of the social forces that influence hospital personnel's HIS acceptance within an organizational context. We use case studies from four public, government-owned hospitals and four privately owned (public and specialty) hospitals to explain the HIS institutionalization process by exploring the three concepts of institutional theory: institutional isomorphism, institutional logic, and institutional entrepreneurship. This study reveals that differences exist between public, government-owned and private hospitals with regard to the institutionalization process: public, government-owned hospitals’ management is more motivated to implement HIS to comply with the regulations, while private hospitals’ management views HIS as an urgent requirement that must be achieved. The study findings also reveal that various institutional isomorphism mechanisms and forms of institutional logic emerge during the process. Finally, three factors—self-efficacy, social influence, and management support—have a significant influence on the individual acceptance of HIS. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to identify and analyse strategic service quality as perception-minus-expectation from patient perspective using SERVQUAL-based Handayani et al.'s framework. The result from 297 respondents shows that the criteria gaps are given as follows in descending order from the biggest gap: (1) responsiveness, (2) assurance, (3) professionalism, (4) reliability, (5) empathy and (6) tangible. Apparently, the gap for each criterion transpires to be significantly different which straightforwardly indicates the quality of the service delivered by hospitals for each criterion is still below respondents' expectations. Recommendation towards hospitals is proposed from technological point of view in forms of IT support in order to significantly improve the process as the dimension of the responsiveness criterion. Nonetheless, suggestion towards the Ministry of Health as the policy maker is also addressed that urges the establishment of policy and its implementation concerning IT support for accelerating hospitals automation.

	<dc:abstract>Web portals' enhancements depend on Information Quality (IQ) that signify customers' needs are being met by producers' directions. IQ assessment result is merely useful for IQ's improvement due to its lack of guidelines to formulate relevant strategies. This research proposes an IQ framework that integrates IQ assessment along with formulation strategies. Holistic results from IQ assessment were interpreted using SWOT and PEST analysis, to ensure formulated strategies were relevant with the identified problems. This research was conducted in Indonesia Kreatif, a web portal with deprived performance in IQ. The resulting formulated strategies reflect how the site's editors can improve the web portal appropriately. Enlarging the scope of information source and specifying detail target for articles productivity in its sub-domains are examples of the strategies resulted worth noting. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The traditional approach for determining potential fishing zones (PFZs) relies on oceanographic factors (biological, physical, and chemical) and fishermen's expertise. This approach has disadvantages particularly when it comes to the analysis of combining these factors to find an exact PFZ spatially and temporally. In this study, we proposed a framework for identifying PFZs based on a data-mining approach in the Eastern Indian Ocean. We utilized a spatio-temporal clustering method to identify clusters of zones with data on the largest number of fish catch, which were then integrated with the sea surface temperature (SST) and the sea surface chlorophyll a (SSC) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. The results of this data integration method were used as training data in the classification process, which was then used to determine PFZs. During the classification process, we utilized the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method. The result gave an average accuracy of 87.11%, which showed that the proposed framework can be used effectively to determine PFZs. To validate the framework, we compared its performance against the heuristic rules taken from the knowledge-based expert system model on the SST and chlorophyll a data. The results showed that the proposed data-mining framework outperformed the heuristic rules from the knowledge-based expert system model. © 2008-2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper aims to investigate the determinants of knowledge management (KM) adoption on organizational and individual level, as well as its impact on non-financial performance through an intermediary of organizational learning ("OL"). The KM adoption model was constructed by using a combination of TOE (Technology, Organizational and Environment) for the organizational level and TPE (Technology, Personal, and Environmental) framework for the individual level; this we called the TOPE (Technology, Personal, Organizational, and Environment) framework. Questionnaires were sent to 60 Indonesian big companies which participated in the Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) Award. Data from 139 respondents (51 companies) was analysed using partial least squares (PLS). This study showed the most essential factors influencing KM adoption and practice are perceived usefulness, ease of use of KM technology, industrial factors, management support, organization culture, and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the factors that are loosely connected to adoption initiative and KM practice are mimetic pressure, strategic planning, and organizational structure. In addition, the result of this study inferred that KM adoption and implementation fairly impact on the improvement of non-financial performance by the intermediary of organizational learning capability improvement.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Web portal's capability in information quality (IQ) will determine its success; especially in complying with user's need. On Indonesia Kreatif web portal, poor IQ can be seen by the low number of visitor penetration and engagement. The aims of this research are to identify users' perception of information quality on Indonesia Kreatif web portal and analyze their causative factors. This research was conducted in three phases: First, the dimensions of IQ was synthesized from numerous previous literatures, followed by an IQ assessment, and finalized with a thorough analysis of their causative factors. The results of this research yielded fourteen IQ dimensions. Additionally, the main causative problems include the low quantity and incomplete published information, coupled with a rigid editor team. For those problems, this research proposed the following recommendations: (1) expand information sources (2) complete the information with mandatory fields, and (3) arrange a routine time schedule from drafting to publishing. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The implementation of customer relationship management (CRM) is one of the most common strategies applied by companies to enhance customer relationship and highly related to technology. In fact, it is not easy to successfully implement this strategy because it requires a huge investment and is influenced by other critical factors. This research aims to synthesise critical success factors (CSFs) from CRM implementation using a systematic literature review approach to papers published in 2001-2014. According to the findings towards 53 relevant papers, technology selection and adaptation (technological readiness) are the most dominant factors. Furthermore, the synthesis finding also shows CSF research shifting to social media, and turns out as the difference between CRM and social CRM implementation. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: To explore the impacts of IT infrastructure flexibility components (connectivity, modularity, compatibility, and IT personnel flexibility) on IT-business strategic alignment using Luftman’s strategic alignment maturity model. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was developed using 5-points Likert scale. The questionnaire was distributed to companies in Indonesia, where 48 companies filled the questionnaire completely. The data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) approach using WarpPLS version 3.0. Findings: This research found that amongst four components of IT infrastructure flexibility, only compatibility that gives a positive and significant impact to IT-business strategic alignment. This finding is remarkably in contrast to what had been found by Chung et al (2003) in which connectivity, modularity and IT personnel flexibility showed a positive impact on strategic alignment while compatibility did not. Research limitations: This research used small sample size. More respondents are required to obtain more general conclusions. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be input for IT investment initiatives by first focusing on compatibility aspect of IT infrastructure which is considered having the most significant influence on strategic alignment. Originality/value: Previous study investigated IT infrastructure flexibility as a single concept, whereas our research investigated the components of IT infrastructure flexibility and their impact on strategic alignment. © 2016, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

	<dc:abstract>In this digital age, information services have been considered as one vital aspect of modern lives. Along with the dramatic increase of social media users, some government agencies have chosen this new media as information services delivery channel. One important aspect that affects user satisfaction of information services through social media is information quality. Hence, this study aims to investigate information quality dimensions that affect user satisfaction of government's information services through media social using a case study of the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemdikbud) in Indonesia. Thus, data of 150 respondents were collected through a survey towards the agency's social media followers. This study found that intrinsic information quality, namely accuracy, believability, reputation and objectivity, is essential to user satisfaction. In terms of representational quality, ease of understanding and interpretability is considered crucial while in the contextual information quality, completeness, timeliness, informativeness and value-added is deemed important. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The trend of citizen journalism enables people to actively share knowledge. This research aimed to analyse which factors influence the individual to share knowledge in citizen media. Our research model was organised using stimulus-organismic-response (SOR) framework by focusing stimulus from social and technological environment. The five points Likert scale questionnaire was developed and distributed to 850 Kompasiana's contributors (the largest citizen media platform in Indonesia) via message feature, thus obtaining 295 valid respondents who fill the questionnaire completely. Those data then were analysed by structural equation modelling method using AMOS 22.0. The result shows that both social and technological environment significantly influences the intention to share knowledge. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Implementing Hospital Information System is an ultimately important practice that should be performed by hospitals in order to deliver accurate, timely, complete, and easily accessible data/information in an integrated manner. Given the specific characteristics of Indonesia, the objective of this research is to design an Information System Architecture as part of the Enterprise Architecture based on The Open Group Architecture Framework in order to support the Hospital Information System implementation in Indonesia. This research focuses on the hospitals basic processes, viz. the emergency processes, the inpatient processes and the outpatient processes. The integration aspect of the architecture should connect the hospitals with other related stakeholders. This research is a qualitative study by conducting interviews and observations in three government public hospitals, several directorate generals of the Indonesian Ministry of Health and a representative from the WHO.

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia initially launched the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) program in early 2014 in an effort to ensure decent living conditions for all of its citizens through national health insurance. This program is mandated by the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia Article 28 and 34 and is also aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) program. However, as part of a program that provides health services, hospitals still have problems, such as the time-consuming administration process from registration to the payment process, which results in patient dissatisfaction and, subsequently, poor quality of hospital services. Therefore, the main purpose of this research is to analyze the dimensions that are required by the hospital to increase the quality of hospital services to meet the stakeholders' (i.e., hospital management, the Ministry of Health as a government policy maker, academicians, and patients) needs and expectations. This research was carried out using a qualitative and quantitative study by conducting interviews and distributing questionnaires to the management group (the Director of Health Efforts Referral [Bina Upaya Kesehatan Rujukan] of the Ministry of Health and the Hospital Accreditation Commission [KARS - Komisi Akreditasi Rumah Sakit]), 23 high-level management officers from 2 public central hospitals, 2 public regional hospitals, and 6 private hospitals, 2 academicians of Public Health and Computer Science, and 297 patients. We analyzed the data using the Entropy method. This research shows that the main dimensions that are necessary to be implemented by the hospitals in order of priority are human resources, process, policy, and infrastructure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: To analyze students’ social media preference in order to improve student engagement with university by examining social media implementation quality in terms of information and service quality. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology is started with the hierarchy creation of student engagement with university which then translated into questionnaire. This questionnaire was distributed to 58 universities in Jakarta (Indonesia’s capital). The questionnaire result was analyzed with entropy and TOPSIS method. Findings: In social media implementation quality, information quality is more important than service quality because in social media, a good information quality is really relevant with the usefulness and comprehensiveness of the information. On the other hand regarding service quality, the system availability will help students in their interaction process with university, on top of the service’s efficiency and fulfillment. This directly impacts the cooperation between students, active learning process, and students’ expectation. The social medias students preferred to improve student engagement with universities respectively are LINE, Facebook, Twitter, Wiki, Blog, Instagram, YouTube, Path, LinkedIn, and Podcast. Research limitations/implications: Social media’s role is not only to create student engagement in the learning process, but also other aspects included by Chickering &amp; Gamson (1987). Practical implications: The Social CRM channel shift from electronic into social media shows that social media holds an important role for university since it eases up the communication between university and the students. The good social media management has been an issue that needs to be solved by university by creating a unit or delegate a person that can manage the social media correctly and quickly so the students feel that they get the good service they want. Originality/value: The other researches focus on observing social media influence to improve student engagement, but only in the context of learning process. This research observes social media roles in student engagement thoroughly according to the existing good practice. This research can also shows the order of social media that are seen important to create student engagement. © 2015, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research aims to understand the nature of the interactions among CRM systems (operational, analytical and collaborative), knowledge creation processes (socialisation, externalisation, combination, and internalisation), and the variety of customer knowledge (knowledge to, from, and about the customer). Only by having a deep understanding of such threeway interactions, will organisations be able to maximise their CRM systems usage and identify areas of knowledge creation capabilities improvement. In this exploratory research, data was gathered qualitatively through a series of interview with key respondents in four different organisations in which CRM was used profoundly. The research findings were similar to the initial research propositions; operational CRM provided stronger support towards socialisation and externalisation processes. Analytical CRM showed support towards combination process, specifically in generating knowledge about customers. Finally, collaborative CRM showed the greatest variety in contributing towards knowledge creation process, for all three types of customer knowledge Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The research aims to provide a roadmap for implementing a safety culture maturity model or SCMM which is critical for enterprise development today. The research methodology consists of two phases. The first phase involves an in-depth study into one oil and gas company as a baseline case. This case helps endorse the seven safety components for the implementation of the SCMM in an enterprise. The second phase compares the baseline case's results with industrial practices. During this phase, the principal component analysis is applied for this comparison. The experts that participated in this second phase helped to verify these findings and to further assist in developing a checklist. For this study, the roadmap consists of the safety components and the checklist. Finally, this research contributes to enterprise development due to the emerging importance of occupational safety and health. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge contributing behaviour as well as knowledge collecting behaviour is essential and necessary in optimising knowledge sharing behaviour. By integrating social cognitive theory (SCT) model and IS success model theory, this research identified and analysed three dimensions of influential factors of knowledge sharing behaviour, namely individual factors, technological factors and contextual factors. Data were collected from virtual community members of information technology in Indonesia and subsequently analysed by using partial least squares (PLS) method. The result showed that the information quality, the norm of reciprocity, the expectation outcomes, the enjoyment in helping others and the interpersonal trust have significant influence in knowledge sharing behaviour. In addition, the result also concluded that knowledge contributing behaviour and knowledge utilisation are particularly important for community promotion activities.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>It is an absolute requirement for the fishing industry to have a management system in order to increase the productivity and the competitiveness in the fishing industry, specially in Indonesia. In this paper we proposed to develop an ICT based integrated tuna fishing management system: E-Fishing Logbook APDATI. The system encompasses all the business process in the fishing industry, start from logging the fishing, licensing, fishing monitoring until the export licensing to the other countries. The system should accomodate all the stakeholders in the fishing industry which are going to be the user of the future system. They are the Minister of The Marine Affair and Fishing (MMAF), the fishing company and the fishing ships. Based on the integrated architecture system proposed in the previous study, we developed the system in two platforms, the web based system and the mobile based system. The development methodology for both systems start from the user requirement analysis until the application design that meets the requirements based on the business process identified. Of all the stages conducted in the system development, we have succeded to design a well suited integrated tuna fishing data management system that contribute to the development of the Indonesian Fishing Industry. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT &amp; LLS.

	<dc:abstract>This study is conducted to analyse factors that influence the behavioural intention to use e-payment system on e-commerce in Indonesia. The proposed model in this research combines behavioural theory of technology acceptance in terms of behavioural beliefs, social influences, and personal innovativeness with the characteristics of an ideal payment system. The model was tested by the structural equation modelling (SEM) using LISREL 8.8 software. The analysis result of 203 respondents showed that Indonesian customers tend to only consider the advantages they gain when adopting e-payment and ignore the risks associated with the technology. Concerning e-payment system characteristics, it was also proven that ease of use, privacy, trust, security, and convertibility influence directly and indirectly the intention to adopt e-payment.

	<dc:abstract>This study was conducted to identify factors influencing the adoption of cloud technologies from the perspective of the benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR). Analyses were performed using DEMATEL which allows seeing the cloud adoption factors on a micro scale. The data was collected by conducting discussions with IT decision makers in the two companies engaged in the mining service sector, namely PTDH and UT, which represented the medium- and large-scale enterprises respectively. By involving both companies, we aimed to explore the impact of organisational characteristics to the cloud technology adoption. The results showed that the adoption of the cloud technology is strongly influenced by organisational characteristics. Internal characteristics of organisations that most influenced the adoption of the cloud technology are the availability of resources, followed by the organisational structure, availability of experts, and support of management in the organisation. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper is aimed to propose a grid density clustering algorithm for spatio-temporal data that is based on the adaptation of the grid density based clustering algorithm. The algorithm is based on AGRID+ algorithm with 7 steps: partitioning, computing distance threshold, calculating densities, compensating densities, calculating density threshold (DT), clustering and removing noises. The adaptation is for the partitioning and calculating the distance threshold (r). The data utilized in this study is spatio-temporal fishery data located around the India Ocean from year 2000 until 2004. We utilized the fishery data in three types of aggregate , daily data, weekly data and monthy data. The result of this study shows that the time complexity for ST-AGRID is outperform the AGRID+. ST-AGRID improves the time complexity and at the same time maintains the accuracy. By utilizing the thresholding technique, clustering result of the ST-AGRID algorithm is identified as the potential fishing zone. © 2015 SERSC.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This chapter aims to analyze the impact of a university's website quality to the intentions of prospective students to enroll at the university. The proposed model was tested by distributing questionnaires to third-year senior high school students around Jakarta. Respondents were asked to follow a series of instructions to access the websites of two universities, the University of Muhammadiyah Malang and the Indonesian Islamic University. After completing the task, respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate website quality. Based on the analysis of 117 valid questionnaires, it is concluded that website quality influences the perception by prospective university students of quality university education, which subsequently affects the intention of prospective students to enroll at the university. The finding confirms that the quality of official websites can be used as an extrinsic attribute to signal the quality of education at the university; thus, its optimal maintenance must be endeavoured. © 2015, IGI Global.

	<dc:abstract>The Internet has been widely applied in the process of buying and selling online, known as e-commerce. Lately, we are seeing substantial growth of e-commerce websites in Indonesia, namely e-marketplace, either in the form of Storefronts, e-Markets, or Virtual Communities. Unfortunately, conducting online transactions carries a negative perception, especially in terms of trust. This research was aimed to formulate a trust presence evaluation tool that is more inclusive of various perspectives in manner. We formulated such evaluation tool from 10 similar studies that were previously conducted. Furthermore, this research also strived to evaluate the portrayal of trust presence in Indonesian e-commerce websites. Through careful observation, we have evaluated trust presence in 100 of Indonesia's top e-commerce websites. The results of this study are the formulation our trust presence evaluation tool, which consists of 9 categories, 29 parameters and 93 indicators. This research also shows site security as the trust presence category that requires the most improvement. Furthermore, Storefronts and E-Markets exhibit trust presence substantially better than that of Virtual Communities. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper introduces the critical success factors framework to develop the application for tuna fishery management. On the previous study, a mentioned framework, consists of four layers: business process layer, information layer, solution layer, and technology layer. Since the framework follows an integrated design, it is important to know the detailed factors influencing the development of fishery management, layer by layer. Some aspects are also then counted in order to see the supporting issue of the development. From the given studies, we propose a conceptual framework of CSFs that consists of 12 critical factors which are considered to be potentially influencing the systems, during the development, and/or usage, and/or maintenance. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Impact of collaborative tools utilization on group performance in university students</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Nowadays the growth of technology influences the changes in group collaboration's process either for the professional or for the students. The requirement of interaction in group collaboration while doing task forces the students to schedule their meeting in order to finish the task given. So the technology starts to influence the process of group collaboration as a communication and interaction media between students in doing their tasks. The purpose of this research is to analyze factors from technology characteristics that drive the students to use collaborative tools, and the implication of using collaborative tools in group collaboration to the group performance. Our research model was validated using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique with LISREL 8.8 tool on 196 respondents from undergraduate and postgraduate students of Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. Our findings showed that the ease of use and perceived usefulness of the collaborative tools drive the students to use collaborative tools when doing their tasks. The existence of collaborative learning is also a driving factor for the students to use collaborative tools. In addition, the use of collaborative tools also showed a positive influence to the team performance. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.</dc:abstract>

Data were collected from 156 students at Universitas Indonesia, who were asked to evaluate user experience of web design on one of the following scenarios: responsive web design in both desktop and mobile device environment and nonresponsive web design in mobile device environment. The user experience quality was measured by looking at the number of clicks and scrolls as well as information quality that has been experienced by user. The results of the ANOVA test proved that responsive web design was able to maintain the user experience quality of website on home functionality, content readability, and enjoyment using website but not on the information architecture. In addition, responsive web design was also proven to reduce the amount of scrolling when reading content. However, responsive web design required more scroll and click than nonresponsive one when exploring its information architecture. © 2014 SERSC.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the last few years, the number of Internet users in Indonesia was growing rapidly as many people started to use e-commerce sites. Utilization of C2C e-commerce in particular has a risk that may reduce people interest in online shopping. Of the many factors that may influence online shopping intention, trust becomes the key. This study built a model to explain the purchase intention in the C2C e-commerce environment. In the model, buyer's trust to the seller is a major factor that influences the purchase intention. Cognitive trust and adoption of e-WOM information is used as a factor that explains how trust is formed. We tested the model by distributing online questionnaires in Kaskus forum, the largest online shopping community in Indonesia. Total 114 valid questionnaire responses were used for analysis. The analysis was conducted using PLS and Smart PLS 2.0 as the tools. Our results showed that trust have a positive and significant effect to the purchase intention. Later it was found that two cognitive trust variables, the perception of ability and integrity of the seller, along with the adoption of e-WOM information have a positive and significant impact on the trust to the seller. © 2014 I.

	<dc:abstract>Even though e-commerce business grows rapidly, still building customer trust on e-commerce becomes more difficult than building customer trust on physical store. This study aims to identify factors that influence customer trust on e-commerce, to compare how important those factors in influencing customer trust and furthermore, to assess how important customer trust for purchase and word of mouth intention. This study combines TOE (Technology, Organizational and Environment) and TPE (Technology, Personal and Environment) framework as reference models used in hypotheses modeling. This research uses quantitative study by conducting survey and accordingly distributing questionnaires to e-commerce users, thus obtaining 151 respondents. The result of this study showed the most essential factors that influence customer trust on e-commerce are web quality and vendor image. This study also revealed that customer trust has positive and significant impact to customer intention to purchase and word of mouth intention.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study was aimed to analyse the obtained value of the company's corporate blog and its supporting factors. We conducted qualitative research by doing deep interview to three consulting firms in Indonesia that are still actively using a corporate blog to analyse the firms practice in managing the corporate blog in terms of motivation of use, functionality, writing ideas and concepts, constraints, policies and their impact on the organisation. We found several key important innovation features in the blog usage, among of them are to show company's identity, to engage company with its clients and society, to educate its employees in order to be known by society, and to walk the talk for increasing client confidence of company's intellectuality. In addition, we also successfully mapped these practices to success factors for sustaining corporate blog. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The health issue today is becoming one of the biggest challenges in Indonesia since the Indonesian Government started the Universal Health Coverage programme in the early 2014. In order to support the programme, hospitals should be equipped with a hospital information system (HIS). This research is aimed at synthesising the critical success factors (CSFs) in implementing HIS in hospitals in Indonesia. This quantitative study is using survey and accordingly distributing questionnaires to the Directorate of the Referral Health Effort of the Ministry of Health, three high rank officials of the Hospital Accreditation Commission, 27 high level management officers of two public central hospitals, two public district general hospitals, nine private hospitals and two academicians of public health and computer science. The study shows the top three CFSs of HIS implementation are, in sequence, top management commitment, thorough communication process, and good project management. Also, eight additional CSFs are proposed for future work. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper aimed to propose an integrated system architecture particularly in tuna fishery data for all the stakeholders in Indonesia. The architecture can be utilized as means of regulating and monitoring the tuna fishing activities for the government of Indonesia. As for the fishing company, the system architecture can assist in good data management, simplifying the fishing license and trading the export tuna. We held study literature in the fishing management and regulations and also on techniques of fishing monitoring in different countries. We also held some interviews and observations both with the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Republic of Indonesia (MMAF) and with the tuna fishing companies. From the data and information collections and analyzing the as-is system, we designed a to-be system through a system architecture based on the enterprise architecture approach. The design consists of 4 layers starting from the business architecture, information architecture, solutions architecture and technology architecture. In order to elaborate the solution architecture we utilize the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach for the application development and their services. The result is an integrated system architecture that can comply with the stakeholders' requirements in managing the fishery data in Indonesia. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this globalization era, companies are required to keep learning and changing. In the process of changing, companies need to be adaptive and innovative. Therefore, a company needs to cultivate and maintain its knowledge. Among other ways, it can be achieved by encouraging the process of knowledge sharing within the company. Hence, this study aims to know the perception of the employee regarding knowledge sharing. An assessment of employee perceptions toward knowledge sharing was conducted by using questionnaires for employees in three consulting companies in Indonesia, namely Pusilkom UI, Altrovis and Usmart. This study concludes that the factors that encourage knowledge sharing are the intrinsic factors rather than the extrinsic factors. Organization can drive the success of knowledge sharing by providing supporting facilities. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Based on Central Agency on Statistic (Badan Pusat Statistik - BPS), the growth of SMEs in Indonesia is increasing rapidly. In order to increase their competitive advantage, SMEs need to implement ERP system. However, most of ERP systems in the today market are very complex and not suitable for Indonesian SMEs. This paper presents the requirements of Indonesian SMEs' main business processes which are focusing in marketing, distributing, selling and production processes by randomly distributing questionnaires to SMEs. Based on our analysis, those processes are urgently needed to be standardized and implemented in ERP system due to their strategies to increase their market share. In addition, this study also conducts the comparison of ERP systems through thorough observation to give insight for SMEs owners if they choose to buy an ERP system. According to our observation, SAP Business One or Compiere Community Edition could be selected by SMEs due to their detailed and complete processes. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information technology has enormous benefits for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) especially to develop innovations in order to enhance their competitiveness. However, currently only few SMEs in Indonesia have used information technology. This study was conducted to examine the factors that influenced SMEs in utilising information technology as well as the impact of information technology utilisation for innovation and performance of SMEs. Based on survey data collected from 115 Indonesian SMEs, it is concluded that the perceived benefits, organisational readiness, and external encouragement have significant positive influence on the utilisation of information technology, with the most dominant factor being organisational readiness. The results also showed that the utilisation of information technology has a significant positive impact on innovation and performance. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a product that enables organizations achieving their competitive advantage. However, the failures of ERP implementation are still considered quite high. This research was conducted to formulate the framework of self-assessment of open source ERP implementation readiness, which focused on the ERP pre-implementation aspects. The proposed ERP implementation readiness assessment framework was developed using the Fuzzy-based ANP (Fuzzy ANP), where the examined readiness factors are grouped into three categories, namely project management, organizational, and change management readiness. In order to see the application of the framework, we conducted a case study on an SME engaged in software development. We did focus group discussion with Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and Project Manager. The results showed that the company is not ready to implement open source ERP. Although the company is strong in the human resources aspect, they are still weak in other aspects so that they need some strategies to improve their level of readiness before implementing open source ERP. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The web-based applications are getting popular due to the ease of development and access that enables users to use them without any limitation of time and place. However, the web faces various risks, particularly to those that exploit applications and systems vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, most of web developers only focus on the application functionality and user interface. This study develops a framework to measure the security awareness level of web developers. We apply the framework to web developers in Indonesia. Our survey results show that their security awareness is in the medium level, thus some aspects need to be improved.

	<dc:abstract>Currently, hospitals are required to improve their quality of health services to meet the higher standards. This improvement is supported by Ministry of Health which has launched electronic health (e-health) program. Under this program, hospitals are required to have Hospital Information System (HIS) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for healthcare. However, to date only a few hospitals have implemented an integrated HIS. The purpose of this research is to asses the Information Technology (IT) maturity of a teaching hospital in implementing HIS. This IT assessment observes from four layers namely business process, Information System (IS), Information Technology (IT) and IS/IT management and organization. The result of this research is that teaching hospitals should prepare a plan to restructure their network with adequate infrastructure, create IT blue print and policy, IT organization restructuring, IT staff competency development and build integrated HIS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Shallow-transfer rule is the main component of shallow-transfer machine translation that matches the pattern of source language and then performs required action to translate them into the target language. However, high development cost is required to build it because it needs much of linguistic knowledge. This paper focuses on the process to automatically generate the shallow-transfer rule for Indonesian-to-English that is followed with manual post-editing to improve the quality of automatic rule. The result shows that the automatic transfer rule can improve the performance of the word-for-word translation. Furthermore, manual post-editing process was also shown to increase the quality of automatic transfer rule. According to this result, using automatic approach is an effective way to build shallow-transfer rule at starting point that can be further enhanced by performing rule post-editing. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-procurement gains its popularity through people's trends of using the internet. Transparancy factor of e-procurements is expected to reduce corruption in government projects, as an effort to achieve good corporate governance (GCG). The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of e-procurement in PT. PLN (Persero). Impacts were assessed by conducting structured interview to the people who were involved in procurement process, such as procurement committees, senior manager of e-procurement applications, business process owner, and developers at PT. PLN. This study focused on the gap analysis of conditions in PT. PLN before and after the implementation of e-procurement. This study concluded that the implementation of e-procurement in PT. PLN gave significant impacts on the total cost of acquisitions, organizational characteristics, governance structure, pre-sourcing business processes, and procurement quotation. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-commerce marketing channel is a media that fully mediated by information technology, depriving the intrinsic attributes of services, and creating information asymmetry. Information asymmetry can reduce consumer ability to evaluate services effectively, hence posing a challenge to service providers. Signaling theory provides a framework for understanding how extrinsic attributes (signals) can be used by service providers to communicate the information quality of services to consumers. This paper proposes a model to investigate how the quality of a university official website acts as a signal of quality of university education as commercial service. This research divides university website quality into several dimensions: Reliability, responsiveness, functionality, ease of use, information quality, and visual appeal. Questionnaires are distributed to third year students of senior high schools around Jakarta to observe the quality of university website based on those dimensions. Based on our analysis, it can be concluded that the quality of a university website influences the perception of the quality of university education, which eventually affects the intentions of prospective students to enroll to the university.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are complex mega-packages, integrated, and allencompassing, systems designed to support the key functional areas of the organization. As a complete system, ERP has huge impacts in business especially in helping companies for reaching competitive advantage for their business. The large amount of investment has been made by the company to implement these systems. However, there are various results of ERP implementation in the companies, from those who gain the huge amount of profit to the ones who get huge disaster. Therefore, it is important for the company to know whether their expenses bring benefits to the company or not. This research aims to formulate a catalog of ERP implementation benefits, which later we used to measure the benefits gained from the ERP implementation in an agricultural company. The catalog was developed by using the five dimensions from Shang and Seddon of ERP benefits framework and 73 subcategories of dimension from Ranti's Generic IS/IT value. Our analysis in the company by using our proposed catalog showed that they have gained the benefits of ERP implementation in the following dimension: operational, managerial, strategic, IT infrastructure, and organizational with the total of 25 categories and 41 subcategories were accepted.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research aims to explore free search engine optimisation (SEO) and social media plug-ins and compare their performance in increasing incoming web traffics. We create three publisher websites: the normal website without any SEO installed on it, the customised website with basic SEO configuration and social media plug-in, and the customised website with advanced SEO configuration and social media plug-in. We run and trace the website log for four and seven months. Our findings show that SEO plug-ins is capable to increase traffic to publisher website. Social media plug-in provides additional benefit to bring traffic, however, the traffic is less significant compared to the one from search engine.

	<dc:abstract>Machine translation from English to Indonesian is required in line with the flood of document written in English. In order to develop shallow-transfer machine translation for English-to-Indonesian, we need shallow-transfer rule to change the structure of English into Indonesian. However, it cost high expense to build it manually from the scratch as it needs much of linguistic knowledge to cover most of the translation rules. In this research, we combine the automatic and manual approach to generate the shallow-transfer rule for English-to-Indonesian. Automatic generated rule is manually post-edited to improve its quality. We compare the performance of system when applying no rule (word-for-word translation), automatic rule and post-edited rule. The result shows that the automatic rule can significantly improve word-for-word translation and post-edited rule also fairly improve the quality of automatic rule. Overall, post-edited rule can significantly improve word-for-word translation by 40.45%. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Company becomes more concern on the role of information technology (IT) as enabler of business. To enhance its performance, it needs to improve service quality, for example by increasing IT investment. This paper aims to analyze the practice of IT investment governance in XYZ Bank and sees its compliance with Val IT 2.0 in order to improve the current practices. Our findings show that project management to run IT investment initiatives has well established and is capable to help the company to achieve its objectives. Moreover, our analysis also show that almost all practices in the current framework can be mapped into Val IT 2.0. It shows a fact that although XYZ Bank has less awareness on IT investment governance framework, its current practices already meet the criteria of such a good IT investment governance. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT) and Statistical Machine translation (SMT) have different approach in performing translation task. RBMT uses linguistic rule between two languages which is built manually by human in general, whereas SMT uses co-occurrence statistic of word in parallel corpora. We combine those different approaches into Indonesian-English Hybrid Machine Translation (HMT) system to get the advantage from both kind of information. Initially, Indonesian text is inputted into RBMT. Then, the output will be edited by SMT to generate the final translation of English text. SMT is capable to do this because on the training process, it uses RBMT's output (English) as source material and real translation (English) as target material. Unavailability of ready to use Indonesian-English RBMT system becomes a challenge to do this research. Our study shows that SMT still outperforms HMT by 8.01% in average. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Image clustering is a process of grouping images based on their similarity. The image clustering usually uses the color component, texture, edge, shape, or mixture of two components, etc. This research aims to explore image clustering using color composition. In order to complete this image clustering, three main components should be considered, which are color space, image representation (feature extraction), and clustering method itself. We aim to explore which composition of these factors will produce the best clustering results by combining various techniques from the three components. The color spaces use RGB, HSV, and L*a*b* method. The image representations use Histogram and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whereas the clustering methods use KMeans and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. The results of the experiment show that GMM representation is better combined with RGB and L*a*b* color space, whereas Histogram is better combined with HSV. The experiments also show that K-Means is better than Agglomerative Hierarchical for images clustering.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The social behavior of peers in peer-to-peer network can be inferred from the observable factors of the system and its components as it is created, lives and evolves. Following a social metaphor, it should be possible to use the observation of these behaviors to organize the network of peers for purposes as various as improving the retrieval performance, efficiently managing storage, improving robustness and increasing security, for instance. In order to concretely illustrate this idea and to precisely quantify its benefits in a concrete scenario, we consider the important example of the improvement of retrieval performance. We propose an unstructured peer-to-peer architecture in which the system, adaptively and in a decentralized manner, learns the expertise and interest of peers, and dynamically re-organizes itself by creating efficient communities (groups) of peers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Routing in unstructured peer-to-peer systems relies either on broadcasting (also called flooding) or on routing indices. An approach using routing indices is only scalable if the routing indices are of manageable size. In this paper, we present a strategy to prune routing indices based on popularity of resources. Routing indices maintain routing information for queries to the most popular resources, leaving queries to other resources to be routed randomly. The popularity of resources at each node of a network is learnt by each routing index, by means of a replacement strategy. We compare the performance of the local popularity method against that of the global popularity method in pruning routing indices in both static and dynamic environments. We compare the effectiveness and the efficiency of two standard replacement strategies: Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Least Recently Used (LRU). Our results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of pruning routing indices based on the local popularity of resources in unstructured peer-to-peer networks. © 2005 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Unstructured peer-to-peer systems rely on strategies and data structures (Routing Indices) for the routing of requests in the network. For those requests corresponding to information retrieval queries, the emphasis can be either put on the effectiveness of the routing by privileging the relevance of the documents retrieved, or on the efficiency of the routing by privileging the response time. We propose in this paper a novel routing strategy based on adaptive Routing Indices. The Routing Indices are adaptive to the environment, i.e. network traffic, location, as well as relevance of the documents indexed, thanks to a reinforcement learning approach to their maintenance. The strategy can be used to tune the compromise between efficient and effective routing. It combines the estimation of the response time of routes with the estimation of the relevance of routes to keywords. We study performance and the tuning of the compromise offered by this novel strategy under various characteristics of the network and traffic. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we presented a routing strategy for requests in unstructured peer-to-peer networks. The strategy is based on the adaptive routing Q-routing. The strategy uses reinforcement learning to estimate the cost of routing a request. Such a strategy is scalable only if the routing indices are of reasonable size. We proposed and comparatively evaluated three methods for the pruning for the pruning of the routing indices. Our experiments confirm the validity of the adaptive routing and the scalability of a pruning approach based on a pruning strategy considering the popularity of the resources. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The effectiveness and efficiency of a charity organization can be achieved by applying information systems. In Indonesia, there are many small, informal, and even unregistered charity organization to serve many unfortunate people who are not covered by the government or well-established charity organization. Those small charity organization does not have enough capacity for human resource to develop and use the information system to provide good administration and good financial report. Development of information systems for charity organizations can be done uniformly to save development costs, but each organization can have different characters and needs. A high effort is needed to adapt and adjust an information system that has been used in other organizations. The development of a charity organization information system using the concept of software product line (SPL) can be done to form a charity organization information system that has a collection of features that can be selected according to the needs of each charity organization. The system that has been developed needs to be supported by learning strategies for users so that they can be used optimally. This research aims to create learning design through a progressive learning approach for the information systems. The feature collection on the developed information system was mapped onto an organizational development model, known as Impact Maturity Model (IMM) so that the features needed at each level of IMM were obtained. Intermediary learning is done through a case study of an information system in the form of a web application called Adaptive Information System for Charity Organization (AISCO). © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an approach that enables user to create multiple products in a single development. The combination of features in a SPLE application causes variation in the user interface. It needs an adaptive user interface with each configuration of the selected features. Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) is a modeling language of Object Management Group (OMG), used to model User Interface (UI) of an application. Using IFML as a modeling language, an abstract UI model will be created to model each feature of the SPLE application. This study uses AISCO (Adaptive Information System for Charity Organizations) as a real case study. This research aims to analyze SPLE application modeling using abstract UI model model and propose a new strategy to generate UI in SPLE. The result of this research is the process of generating UI using IFML in SPLE. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We choose Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the foundation to model the proposed solution of the Multi Software Product Lines (MPL) interoperability challenge. The proposed pseudo-code is modeled as an extension of the UML meta-model to support MPL. The model serves to provide a standard representation of MPL and an intuitive transformation to an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. Some extension to the UML that yet to have intuitive translation into common OO language are augmented with a mechanism using a build automation system. This mechanism provides manual transformation that gives us some hints whether the proposed solution fulfilled the evaluation criteria. The given challenge case has been written in our proposed pseudo-code, modeled in our UML extension, and translated into Java source code and Gradle build scripts. By invoking Gradle tasks, we can simulate product generation that creates products as Java objects. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Product Line (SPL) promises to accelerate the development process with higher quality of product and low budget of production. The essential key of SPL is feature diagram which describes the relation between features for the domain and captures the commonalities and variabilities. The approach gains numerous attention in research and industry area. However, the implementation of SPL approach for information system development is still inadequate. Some works explain the inclusion of ontology for SPL such as having feature diagram in ontology language. The inclusion benefits to produce an information system automatically. On the other side, the executable modelling language such as Abstract Behavioural Specification (ABS) can be utilized to implement the feature diagram for distributed object-oriented systems. The trend of ABS expands to accommodate microservices-based software variabilities, that is ABS Microservices Framework. The Framework allows to build different services for different devices who consume the data from ABS. However, these two area of research have not been integrated. We propose an adaptor to integrate the ABS microservices and ontology-based information system to produce automated business logics into the system. We show that by using the ontology as its basis, the system is semantically structured and the business logics required by the system is updated automatically. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Product Lines (SPL) support the concept of software mass production and customization by defining the commonalities and variability of related software products using a notion of features. The features of SPLs and their interdependencies are typically organized in feature models. These capture the product variations by defining permissible feature combinations. Analysis of feature models aims to extract valuable information and build a better software product line. The current implementation of automated analysis of feature models in Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is using Choco Solver 2, a Java library for constraint satisfaction problems. Our work in this research was to port the implementation to the newest version of Choco Solver, namely Choco 4. Additionally, we extended the set of feature model analyses by adding new useful operations. An evaluation has been conducted to analyze the time performance. As a result, Choco 2 outperformed Choco 4 in case of deriving all solutions, while Choco 4 is better when deriving single solutions. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims to produce variant-rich software with features based on diverse user requirements. SPLE uses the term feature to express system commonalities and variabilities. The Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is an executable modeling language that supports SPLE. It uses feature models to declare and organize software variability as a tree of nested features. Users select the specific features they need based on this feature model. Such a selection process can be a too complex task if the number of features is quite large. In this research we propose to apply a grouping mechanism to the features of a feature model in order to reduce the complexity of the feature selection performed by the user. Using this mechanism the user selects the features in a software product based on groups instead of the more complex original feature model structure. We implemented the grouping mechanism as part of the ABS tool suite. The resulting groups are visualized using a simple web application. Case studies were employed to evaluate the proposed grouping mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>There has been an increasing number of charities worldwide. However, transparency and imbalanced distribution are still critical issues in this sector. Despite the Web has been exploited for several purposes in numerous sectors, its potential has not been fully employed by not-for-profit organizations. Due to the variability of the organizations, it is not easy to provide a one application-fit-all open source applications. Many small organizations are very active but still lack of qualified resources to provide IT supports. Thus, we endeavour to develop an adaptive system for different charity organizations in a single development with Software Product Lines (SPL) as its approach to deal with the charities problems. In this paper, we introduce a platform to generate the charities systems with ABS as a core architecture to support SPL. We present how the products are generated by the system. However, the system does not have rich UI/UX variations. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Microservices architecture is a software development style that divides software into several small, independently deployable services. Every service can be invoked by standard protocols such as HTTP, so it can be used on a variety of platforms (e.g. mobile, web, desktop). The diversity of users of microservices-based software causes an increased variation in software requirements. In order to accommodate this variability, we propose a framework for microservices-based software based on the Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) approach. We call this framework ABS Microservices Framework, as it relies on the Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) language development platform that readily supports SPLE. The framework created in this research has shown more flexibility to accommodate software variability than other microservices frameworks. Hence, the ABS Microservices Framework can support the software industry to distribute variable software of high quality and reliability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Producing software variations from the same software product line requires developers to adopt developing tools that support variability. The Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is a modeling language that facilitates the generation of various software products from a single code base. One part of ABS is the Product Selection Language (PSL), which is used to specify software products as sets of features. Even though some products might share some features, using PSL, all features in a product need to be stated one by one. If the product is obtained from tens to hundreds of features, defining the product will be difficult and inefficient To remedy this situation, we extend the PSL such that products can be declared incrementally, by referring to other products. Such declarations contain product expressions that use set-theoretic operations (i.e., union, intersection, complement) over products and sets of features. We evaluate our extended PSL with a case study of a Charity Organization System developed at the RSE Research Lab in the Faculty of Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Feature-based approaches to software design, like delta-oriented programming, are well-suited to support multi-product software development paradigms, such as Software Product Lines. Currently, the popular UML notation does not support delta-oriented software design, so that several ad-hoc notations tend to be used. This paper presents a systematic approach to import concepts from delta-oriented programming into the mainstream notation UML. This is done with minimal overhead by specifying a new, slim, delta-oriented UML profile. It is compatible with languages that support delta-oriented programming such as DeltaJ and ABS. The usefulness of the profile is evaluated with a case study. © 2016 ACM.</dc:abstract>

Concept Relationship Oriented methodology is one of its result, the methodology can be used, to develop new artifact for reverse engineering. There are two significant reported activities: searching Concept Representation, and searching Structure of Concept. Searching Concept Representation was a process, to find a representation, proper or might exist less depend on artifact types (for example: unique concepts). In this stage dependency on level of abstraction still tight, but at the second stage we found the representation, Structure of Concept. © 2015 by the authors. Copying.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposes a model of distributed self-organizing traffc control with self-organizing map in real situation. This model can be used as a general setting for controlling almost any type of intersection. It uses nonlinear coupled oscillator with multiway intersection and automatically adjusts the cycle time, split, and offset parameter of the controller.

	<dc:abstract>Urban traffic control is the main factor that contributes to traffic jam. Approach in distributed Urban traffic control has been developed in several research, but the coordinating controller factor is basically a quite complicated task to tackle, because between intersection have dependency, so required a method of distributed control system capable for synchronizing between intersections. In this paper we present architecture of decentralized self-organizing traffic control with swarm-self organizing map in real situation even on non-structure intersections like in Jakarta (Indonesia). Based on the proposed architecture we have been implemented Traffic Signal Control System for controlling traffic lights in which the coordination between the intersections is implemented using distributed swarm self-organizing map. Traffic Signal Control System were tested in a simulated real-road scenario of Jakarta. By means of the computer simulation, the application of distributed swarm signal self-organizing control is proved effective in urban traffic.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes a technique combining higher order functions, algebraic datatypes, and monads to incrementally implement syntax driven logics. Extensions can be compositionally stacked while the base logic is left unchanged. The technique can furthermore be used to build a set of weaker logics for light weight verification or to generate validation traces. The paper explains the technique through an example: a Hoare logic for a simple command language. The example also shows how exceptions can be treated as an extension, without having to change the underlying logic. © 2006 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Compositionality provides the foundation of software modularity, re-usability and separate verification of software components. One of the known difficulties, when separately verifying components, is producing compositional proofs for progress properties of distributed systems. This paper offers a UNITY-based framework to model distributed applications which are built with a component based approach. The framework enables components to be abstractly specified in terms of contracts. Temporal properties are expressed and proven in the UNITY style. Compositional reasoning about components' properties, including progress, is supported. The semantical model is simple and intuitive. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As the growth of technology, the need of internet increases. Wireless internet technology or called Wi-Fi is dominate. Hence, monitoring the usage of Wi-Fi is crucial. Community detection is a technique which can be used to understand browsing behavior analysis. Using this approach, a website is represented as a node in a graph and the transition over websites is represented as an edge where the weight of an edge is calculated based on the frequency of website transition. In this study, we implement two community detection algorithms which support directed and weighted graph, i.e Girvan-Newman and Infomap to know the communities of websites accessed by Wi-Fi users. An evaluation metrics named modularity is employed to access the quality of both algorithms. The results of our experiment show that Infomap performs better to detect communities than Girvan-Newman. Based on browsing behavior analysis, it can be understood that the Wi-Fi network is mostly used for education, entertainment and government purposes. However, we also obtain insight regarding the misbehavior activities which need prevention. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>PT Pertamina (Persero), an energy-sector company, launched an efficiency program on all fronts in 2015. Corporate Shared Service, a function which responsible for providing information technology services in Pertamina, contributes to that program by providing video conference service as a replacement for regular meetings. However, according to the Vice President of IT Operation, the provisioning of the service needs to be improved. One of the needed improvements is the need to create a formal policy and procedure for provisioning the service. Thus, this work aims to design the policy and procedure for video conference service in PT Pertamina (Persero). We employed the two-strands model of Soft-System Methodology in designing the policy and procedure. The design of the policy and procedure are based on ITIL, which is the best practice for IT service management, and ISO/IEC 20000, which is the standard for IT service management. The work produced three policy and procedure documents, and implementation strategy and change management. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the challenges during game development is to find a way on how to make the players actually enjoy the game itself while being quite hooked by its gameplay. In almost in every game, player must play the game through challenges to complete the game's main objectives. Enjoyment is highest when the game's challenges, which are either hard-coded or adaptively put forth by AI, are of appropriate difficulty with respect to the player's skill. In order to balance out between these two aspects, a difficulty adjustment is needed. In this paper, we study an application of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MTCS) for creating such a balancing using role playing games as the case study. The key idea is the intuition that a game's difficulty is balanced if any of the player or the AI can win or lose the game by only a small margin. We conduct experiment to see if the method is appropriate for this problem. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Interest in Semantic Web technologies, including knowledge graphs and ontologies, is increasing rapidly in industry and academics. In order to support ontology engineers and domain experts, it is necessary to provide them with robust tools that facilitate the ontology engineering process. Often, the schema diagram of an ontology is the most important tool for quickly conveying the overall purpose of an ontology. In this paper, we present a method for programmatically generating a schema diagram from an OWL file. We evaluate its ability to generate schema diagrams similar to manually drawn schema diagrams and show that it outperforms VOWL and OWLGrEd. In addition, we provide a prototype implementation of this tool. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Decision Support System (DSS) is a support tool in helping users to provide suggestions of decisions when the information is disorganized and has a complex problem. Eventually, the dynamics of data on certain domains is unclear, semantic interoperability and heterogeneous data sources. To address solve the problem, the ontology can be applied to perform knowledge representation. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of ontology in developing DSS as a supporter of multi-criteria decision-making. This study used Kitchenham's methodology to assist in literature review. There are five journals electronic databases selected as references, such as, Science Direct, IEEE, Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Springer Link This study obtained 21 final articles that were synthesized to answer research questions. The ontology-based DSS delivers a deeper analysis of the decision situation and suggests a new methodology which can affords accurate results of calculation. Though most of the studies present that the ontology is not integrated with DSS techniques. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Big data is a hot topic that is regularly discussed in the computer science field for the past year. Big data provides numerous benefits for the development of technologies, such as business intelligence and deep learning. Processing big data requires specialized tools and environment, ranging from a commodity-clustered workstation to high performance computing server, especially in big data clustering where unsupervised learning takes place. In this paper, we conduct time analysis of commodity-clustered workstation equipped with Spark as a baseline for multi-CPU big data clustering and TensorFlow installed in a high-performance computing workstation as a baseline for multi-GPU big data clustering. Based on the analysis, it shows that TensorFlow performs have around 5 to 12 times faster computation time than Spark. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study proposes a unique ontology development methodology, called blended methodology for assessment based competency ontology and presents the step by step developing of ontology for competency certification domain. This blended approach is driven by following combination of TOVE, METHONTOLOGY and YAMO method. The methods confirm the quality of the ontology design, more precisely; reuse and complete. Approach for this blended method was adopted from the YAMO method, namely a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. Thus, assessment based competency domain, formally defined ontology is designed. In the development of an ontology, a group of people was interviewed to determine the scope and domain boundaries. The finding attained from the results of the ontology evaluation in this study are quite impressive. The evaluation phase was found that 74% of the expert's queries were successfully met. This percentage shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the blended methodology based on ontology have been successfully built This work predict that the existing work will have great implications on the ontology researcher and practitioners. This paper describes a novel ontology development methodology and presented how the methodology can be applied to construct reuse domain ontology. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Currently, information overload can make selecting the information appropriately as time consuming needs. Therefore created a recommender system that helps the selection of information appropriately and personalized as needed. A system recommender has various types and support techniques to determine recommendations, including ontology and machine learning. Ontology is a conceptualization of the representation of knowledge that can be translated into machine language as well as machine learning which is the formalization of human learning applied to the computer in order to gain knowledge from the real world is considered as techniques that can help find the right recommendations. This study conducted of 750 previous studies that have been carefully analyzed using the Kitchenham method to find the most commonly used recommender system and the roles of both techniques in the system recommendations. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Ontology alignment has been studied for over a decade, and over that time many alignment systems and methods have been developed by researchers in order to find simple 1-to-1 equivalence matches between two ontologies. However, very few alignment systems focus on finding complex correspondences. One reason for this limitation may be that there are no widely accepted alignment benchmarks that contain such complex relationships. In this paper, we propose a real-world dataset from the GeoLink project as a potential complex alignment benchmark. The dataset consists of two ontologies, the GeoLink Base Ontology (GBO) and the GeoLink Modular Ontology (GMO), as well as a manually created reference alignment, that was developed in consultation with domain experts from different institutions. The alignment includes 1:1, 1:n, and m:n equivalence and subsumption correspondences, and is available in both Expressive and Declarative Ontology Alignment Language (EDOAL) and rule syntax. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In our experience, the modeling of events of all sorts is often central in ontology development. Indeed, many proposals for models of events exist, some in the form of lightweight vocabulary, and some in the form elaborately axiomatized ontologies. However, there is as of now no clear, generic, and concisely described pattern for modeling events as part of an ontology. In this brief paper, we describe such a core, minimalistic, generic pattern, and we describe it in the way in which we would have found it useful in our own modeling activities. We do not claim a lot of originality in doing this, we are rather filling an obvious gap in the ontology design patterns landscape. © 2017 Karl Hammar, Pascal Hitzler, Adila Krisnadhi, Agnieszka Ławrynowicz, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese, Monika Solanki (Eds.).

	<dc:abstract>The study of patterns in the context of ontology engineering for the semantic web was pioneered more than a decade ago by Blomqvist, Sandkuhl and Gangemi. Since then, this line of research has flourished and led to the development of ontology design patterns, knowledge patterns, and linked data patterns: the patterns as they are known by ontology designers, knowledge engineers, and linked data publishers, respectively. A key characteristic of those patterns is that they are modular and reusable solutions to recurrent problems in ontology engineering and linked data publishing. This book contains recent contributions which advance the state of the art on theory and use of ontology design patterns. The papers collected in this book cover a range of topics, from a method to instantiate content patterns, a proposal on how to document a content pattern, to a number of patterns emerging in ontology modeling in various situations. © 2017 Karl Hammar, Pascal Hitzler, Adila Krisnadhi, Agnieszka Ławrynowicz, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese, Monika Solanki (Eds.).

	<dc:abstract>Academic evaluation is an important activity regularly conducted by every higher education institution to gauge the performance of education services and help the administrators of the institution improve the quality of those services. Implementation of academic evaluation almost always requires an integration of relevant data, which are often scattered in separate systems. Such an integration effort is often tedious and time consuming because the data must be gathered from different systems, manually integrated, and then presented in a format that meets some pre-determined academic evaluation criteria. One way to help reducing the amount of effort expended in the integration is to make the data available in a format that enables linking between any part of the data and allows various academic evaluation queries to be performed on them. Our work intends to realise this idea by using Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontology and linked data. In particular, our work is situated in a concrete use case based on the academic evaluation process as periodically conducted in Universitas Indonesia (UI). In this paper, we focus on the first step of this effort, namely the development of an ontology for academic evaluation with a particular emphasis on evaluation of undergraduate degree programs in UI. There has been a number of prior work focusing on the development of an ontology for a similar problem, yet none of them takes into account the fact that academic data evolve over time. Our ontology thus accounts for this aspect according to the UIs academic evaluation criteria. We also demonstrate that the ontology can be used as a basis in answering SPARQL queries that capture those criteria, which indicates the suitability and usability of the ontology. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>It has been argued that it is much easier to convey logical statements using rules rather than OWL (or description logic (DL)) axioms. Based on recent theoretical developments on transformations between rules and DLs, we have developed ROWLTab, a Protégé plugin that allows users to enter OWL axioms by way of rules; the plugin then automatically converts these rules into OWL 2 DL axioms if possible, and prompts the user in case such a conversion is not possible without weakening the semantics of the rule. In this paper, we present ROWLTab, together with a user evaluation of its effectiveness compared to entering axioms using the standard Protégé interface.

	<dc:abstract>In this work we introduce a content Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) to model and reason about material transformations, a concept that occurs in many different domains ranging from computational chemistry, biology, and industrial ecology to architecture. We model the relationships between inputs, outputs, and catalysts in the transformation process as well as the spatial and temporal constraints necessary for a transformation to occur. Both a graphical illustration and a formal axiomatization are provided, and the commonalities and differences to similar ontologies and patterns are discussed. Usage of the pattern is illustrated by applying it to an intuitive and familiar example and by discussing how the pattern is able to address a set of competency questions. Additionally, we present a detailed use case from the domain of sustainable construction that leverages the material transformation pattern in combination with the already-existing semantic trajectory ontology design pattern. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

	<dc:abstract>In ontology engineering, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous domains and their subfields, legacy data, various data models, existing standards, code lists, and so forth, there is a frequently recurring need to express certain types of axioms that allow diverse representational choices interoperate. Some of these axioms, which we call typecasting axioms, point to limitations of the Web Ontology Language (OWL), while others require best practice guides for the community. Here, we introduce these typecasting axioms and elaborate how such axioms can help the development of data integration using ontology and ontology patterns. We then conclude with a brief catalog of open research problems motivated by typecasting axioms, which may be of potential interest to both application developers and researchers working on logical foundations of OWL. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In our experience, some ontology users find it much easier to convey logical statements using rules rather than OWL (or description logic) axioms. Based on recent theoretical developments on transformations between rules and description logics, we develop ROWL, a Protégé plugin that allows users to enter OWL axioms by way of rules; the plugin then automatically converts these rules into OWL DL axioms if possible, and prompts the user in case such a conversion is not possible without weakening the semantics of the rule.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research describes an ontology design pattern for dynamically conceptualizing, establishing, tracking, and updating relative relationships and dependencies between entities (real or representational) of a physical, temporal, and/or importance scope. We present a Relative Relationship (RR) Pattern, associated axioms, an implementation of current geometric scale translation research, a detailed example, and suggestions for other potential use cases. It provides data hooks that allow dynamic updating of linked data as changes occur in preference systems, scaling systems, or time expiration parameters; additionally, it separates the false notion that level of detail is always synonymous with scope. Furthermore, we discuss how this design pattern potentially acts as an intermediate step to assist the transition between open linked-data and decision support frameworks that need to readily update changes within the accurate data over modern, distributed data access points.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper discusses the relationship between ontology de- sign patterns (ODPs), data models and linked data, proposing a method that simplifies the task of publishing linked data while adhering to good modeling practices that reuse well-studied ODPs. The method consists of providing the pattern along with a simplified view of it, the conversion queries to transform one into the other and the constraints to verify pattern conformance. The proposed process simplifies the tasks of the domain experts but preserves the integrity of the design patterns, favoring a well-designed and well documented data model which fosters data reuse. The work is illustrated with a linked dataset of chess games with the key information mapped to other linked datasets and supported by formalized design patterns. A chess dataset is presented as linked data.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present an ontology pattern describing records of chess games. Besides being an interesting modeling problem by itself, the fact that chess is one of the most popular game in the world with hundreds of millions of active players, including several millions online players led to a huge amount of chess game data available from various online chess databases. Furthermore, these data are becoming available as linked data with links to prominent datasets, such as DBPedia or GeoNames. However, there is still a lack of a well-designed schema that can ease linked data publishing of chess games. Our pattern is hoped to fill that gap.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluates the environmental impact of a product through its entire life cycle, from material extraction to final disposal or recycling. The environmental impacts of an activity depend on both the activity's direct emissions to the environment as well as indirect emissions caused by activities elsewhere in the supply chain. Both the impacts of direct emissions and the provisioning of supply chain inputs to an activity depend on the activity's spatiotemporal scope. When accounting for spatiotemporal dynamics, LCA often faces significant data interoperability challenges. Ontologies and Semantic technologies can foster interoperability between diverse data sets from a variety of domains. Thus, this paper presents an ontology for modeling spatiotemporal scopes, i.e., the contexts in which impact estimates are valid.We discuss selected axioms and illustrate the use of the ontology by providing an example from LCA practice. The ontology enables practitioners to address key competency questions regarding the effect of spatiotemporal scopes on environmental impact estimation.</dc:abstract>

R2R curates digital data and documentation generated by environmental sensor systems installed on vessels from the U.S. academic research eet, with support from the NSF Oceanographic Technical Services and Arctic Research Logistics Programs. BCO-DMO human-curates and maintains data and metadata including biological, chemical, and physical measurements and results from projects funded by the NSF Biological Oceanography, Chemical Oceanography, and Antarctic Organisms &amp; Ecosystems Programs.

	<dc:abstract>EarthCube is a major effort of the National Science Foundation to establish a next-generation knowledge architecture for the broader geosciences. Data storage, retrieval, access, and reuse are central parts of this new effort. Currently, EarthCube is organized around several building blocks and research coordination networks. OceanLink is a semantics-enabled building block that aims at improving data retrieval and reuse via ontologies, Semantic Web technologies, and Linked Data for the ocean sciences. Cruises, in the sense of research expeditions, are central events for ocean scientists. Consequently, information about these cruises and the involved vessels is of primary interest for oceanographers, and thus, needs to be shared and made retrievable. In this paper, we report the use of a design pattern-centric strategy to model Cruise for OceanLink data integration. We provide a formal axiomatization of the introduced pattern using the Web Ontology Language, explain design choices and discuss the planned deployment and application scenarios of our model. © 2015 AKA Verlag Berlin.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies the environmental impact of products taking into account their entire life-span and production chain. This requires gathering data from a variety of heterogeneous sources into a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI). LCI preparation involves the integration of observations and engineering models with reference data and literature results from around the world, from different domains, and at varying levels of granularity. Existing LCA data formats only address syntactic interoperability, thereby ignoring semantics. This leads to a variety of challenges, e.g., difficulties in reproducing assessments published in the literature. In this work, we present an ontology pattern that specifies key aspects of LCA/LCI data models, namely the notions of ows, activities, agents, and products, as well as their properties.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The concepts of scale is at the core of cartographic abstraction and mapping. It defines which geographic phenomena should be displayed, which type of geometry and map symbol to use, which measures can be taken, as well as the degree to which features need to be exaggerated or spatially displaced. In this work, we present an ontology design pattern for map scaling using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) within a particular extension of the OWL RL profile. We explain how it can be used to describe scaling applications, to reason over scale levels, and geometric representations. We propose an axiomatization that allows us to impose meaningful constraints on the pattern, and, thus, to go beyond simple surface semantics. Interestingly, this includes several functional constraints currently not expressible in any of the OWL profiles. We show that for this specific scenario, the addition of such constraints does not increase the reasoning complexity which remains tractable. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposes an addition to OWL 2 syntax to incorporate nominal schemas, which is a new description-logic style extension of OWL 2 which was recently proposed, and which makes is possible to express "variable nominal classes" within axioms in an OWL 2 ontology. Nominal schemas make it possible to express DL-safe rules of arbitrary arity within the extended OWL paradigm, hence covering the well-known DL-safe SWRL language. To express this feature, we extend OWL 2 syntax to include necessary and minimal modifications to both Functional and Manchester syntax grammars and mappings from these two syntaxes to Turtle/RDF. We ało include several examples to clarify the proposal.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nominal schema is an expressive description logic (DL) construct that was proposed in recent efforts to integrate DLs and (logic programming) rule-based paradigms for the Semantic Web [1] represented by two “diverging” W3C1 standards: the DL-based Web Ontology Language (OWL) [2] whose major variant, OWL 2 DL, is based on the description logic (DL) SROIQ [3]; and the rulebased Rule Interchange Format (RIF) whose core variant, called RIF Core [4], is essentially Datalog, i.e., function-free Horn logic. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As part of the quest for a unifying logic for the SemanticWeb Technology Stack,1 a central issue is finding suitable ways of integrating description logics based on theWeb Ontology Language (OWL) with rulebased approaches based on logic programming. Such integration is difficult since naive approaches typically result in the violation of one ormore desirable design principles. For example, while both OWL 2 DL and RIF Core (a dialect of the Rule Interchange Format RIF) are decidable, their naive union is not, unless carefully chosen syntactic restrictions are applied. We report on recent advances and ongoing work by the authors in integrating OWL and rules. We take an OWL-centric perspective, which means that we take OWL 2 DL as a starting point and pursue the question of how features of rule-based formalisms can be added without jeopardizing decidability. We also report on incorporating the closed world assumption and on reasoning algorithms. This paper essentially serves as an entry point to the original papers, to which we will refer throughout, where detailed expositions of the results can be found. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A combination of open and closed-world reasoning (usually called local closed world reasoning) is a desirable capability of knowledge representation formalisms for Semantic Web applications. However, none of the proposals made to date for extending description logics with local closed world capabilities has had any significant impact on applications. We believe that one of the key reasons for this is that current proposals fail to provide approaches which are intuitively accessible for application developers and at the same time are applicable, as extensions, to expressive description logics such as SROIQ, which underlies the Web Ontology Language OWL. In this paper we propose a new approach which overcomes key limitations of other major proposals made to date. It is based on an adaptation of circumscriptive description logics which, in contrast to previously reported circumscription proposals, is applicable to SROIQ without rendering reasoning over the resulting language undecidable.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a new approach to adding closed world reasoning to the Web Ontology Language OWL. It transcends previous work on circumscriptive description logics which had the drawback of yielding an undecidable logic unless severe restrictions were imposed. In particular, it was not possible, in general, to apply local closure to roles. In this paper, we provide a new approach, called grounded circumscription, which is applicable to SROIQ and other description logics around OWL without these restrictions. We show that the resulting language is decidable, and we derive an upper complexity bound. We also provide a decision procedure in the form of a tableaux algorithm. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Traffic jam often occurs around the signalized intersection because each takes "stop-and-go cost" to pass through the intersection. Stop-and-go cost traffic increases air pollution and gas consumption, produces greater wear and tear on vehicles, and costs people and businesses money in the delay it imposes. Hence, traffic signal control has significant meanings in reducing the traffic jams efficiently. A modification method of traffic signal control management based on self-organizing is introduced. The self-organizing observed in non-linier coupled oscillators is referred to as "synchronization", where oscillators having difference natural frequencies are phase locked with some phase delay as result of their mutual or one-side intersection. Simulation illustrate that the new approach is technically sound, moreover it can be implemented in real situation even in non-structure intersection like in Indonesia. ©2009 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The results of our investigation are summarized in Table 1, and in all cases they apply both to instance checking and conjunctive query entailment. The coNP upper bounds are a consequence of the results in [9]. When the UNA is not explicitly mentioned, the results hold both with and without UNA. We point out two interesting issues. First, for all of the considered extensions we were able to show tractability regarding data complexity if and only if the logic is convex regarding instances, i.e., A, T |= C(a) with C = D0 t · · · U Dn-1 implies A, T |= Di(a) for some i &amp;lt; n. It would be interesting to capture this phenomenon in a general result. And second, it is interesting to point out that subtle differences such as the UNA or local versus global functionality (for the latter, see EL(≤1r) vs. ELIf ) can have an impact on tractability. As future work, it would be interesting extend our upper bound by including more operators from the tractable description logic EL++ as proposed in [1]. For a start, it is not hard to show that conjunctive query entailment in full EL++ is undecidable due to the presence of role inclusions r1 ± r2 s. In the following, we briefly sketch the proof, which is by reduction of the problem of deciding whether the intersection of two languages defined by given context-free grammars Gi = (Ni, T, Pi, Si), i ∈ {1, 2}, is empty. We assume w.l.o.g. that the set of non-terminals N1 and N2 are disjoint. Then define a TBox T := {T v ra | a ∈ T} [ {rA1..... rAn rA | A → A1 · · ·An ∈ P1 [ P2}. It is not too difficult to see that L(G1)\L(G2) ≠ θ iff the conjunctive query S1(u, v)^ S2(u, v) is matched by the ABox {T(a)} and TBox T . © 2007 by Bozen-Bolzano University Press.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We study the data complexity of instance checking and conjunctive query answering in the ε Lscr; family of description logics, with a particular emphasis on the boundary of tractability. We identify a large number of intractable extensions of ε Lscr;, but also show that in εℒI f, the extension of ε ℒ with inverse roles and global functionality, conjunctive query answering is tractable regarding data complexity. In contrast, already instance checking in ε ℒ extended with only inverse roles or global functionality is EXPTIME-complete regarding combined complexity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Privacy-preservation in data aggregation in large scale Internet of Things applications is challenging. Sensitive data from a result of collecting sensor data needs attentions to address privacy issues. We present a privacy-preserving model to protect data aggregation between sensor gateway and storage servers. Our proposed scheme is designed for decentralized networks and passwordless by obfuscating sensor data. We design, implement and evaluate a practical privacy-preserving system using deep learning autoencoder with convolutional neural network architecture. We do a statistical analysis and perform simulation on computer and IoT board machines. Evaluation process involves training and testing phases with a dataset. We measure system accuracy and computation time. The simulation and experimental results show that privacy-preserving-based deep learning model can address privacy issues on data aggregation and guarantee scalability and performance on applications. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In addressing the growing problem of security of Internet of Things, we present, from a statistical decision point of view, a naval approach for trust-based access control using Bayesian decision theory. We build a trust model, TrustBayes which represents a trust level for identity management in IoT. TrustBayes model is be applied to address access control on uncertainty environment where identities are not known in advance. The model consists of EX (Experience), KN (Knowledge) and RC (Recommendation) values which is be obtained in measurement while a IoT device requests to access a resource. A decision will be taken based model parameters and be computed using Bayesian decision rules. To evaluate our a trust model, we do a statistical analysis and simulate it using OMNeT++ to investigate battery usage. The simulation result shows that the Bayesian decision theory approach for trust based access control guarantees scalability and it is energy efficient as increasing number of devices and not affecting the functioning and performance. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The current trend in operator networking is towards supporting the communication of devices which do not require human intervention for information gathering, processing and exchange over the network, generically named Machine Type Communication (MTC). This paradigm aims to increase the level of system automation in which the devices and systems can exchange and share data, facilitating the communication for other industry branches resulting in new services such as smart cities, smart grids etc. This paper introduces the OpenMTC platform a software reference implementation of the ETSI M2M standards including advanced features for machine communication, application integration, remote management and integration with available sensors and actuators. OpenMTC in addition to fostering research and development enables academic and industry researchers to rapidly realize testbeds and demonstrations in the MTC communication area. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Team and individual capability in the software testing depends heavily on the maturity level in the conducting a software testing activities. This paper is the result of qualitative research in comparing software testing maturity frameworks that has been proposed by some researchers. In the context of software process improvement, interesting results obtained when more in-depth evaluation between TMMi, TPI Next, and Test SPICE 3.0. This paper presents comparisons between these three frameworks that are equivalent to process reference models and have their own best practices. These three frameworks can be considered to be used as an improvement in the software testing process, with the trade off in the selecting of either one. In addition, a summary of the chosen frameworks implementation examples is also given. The results of this study are very important as a reference for the organization in preparing software capability roadmap in software testing. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Users of online job search tools interact with result pages in three different ways: via impressions, via clicks, and via applications. We investigate the relationship between these three kinds of interaction using logs provided by Seek.com, an Australian-based job search service. Our focus is on understanding the extent to which the three interaction types can be used to predict each other. In particular we examine models for inferring impressions from clicks, thereby providing system designers with new options for evaluating search result pages. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Open Information Extraction (Open IE), which has been extensively studied as a new paradigm on unrestricted information extraction, produces relation tuples (results) which serve as intermediate structures in several natural language processing tasks, one of which is question answering system. In this paper, we investigate ways to learn the vector representation of Open IE relation tuples using various approaches, ranging from simple vector composition to more advanced methods, such as recursive autoencoder (RAE). The quality of vector representation was evaluated by conducting experiments on the relation tuple similarity task. While the results show that simple linear combination (i.e., averaging the vectors of the words participating in the tuple) outperforms any other methods, including RAE, RAE itself has its own advantage in dealing with a case, in which the similarity criterion is characterized by each element in the tuple, in cases where the simple linear combination is unable to identify them. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Given a SERP in response to a user-originated query, Moffat et al. (CIKM 2013; TOIS 2017) suggest that C(i), the conditional continuation probability of the user examining the (i + 1) st element presented in the SERP, given that they are known to have examined the i th one, is positively correlated with both i and with the user's initial estimate of the volume of answer pages they are looking for, and negatively correlated with the extent to which suitable answer pages have been identified in the SERP at positions 1 through i. Here we first describe a methodology for specifying how C(i) should be defined in practical (as against ideal) settings, and then evaluate the applicability of the approach using three large search interaction logs from two different sources. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We consider two recent proposals for effectiveness metrics that have been argued to be adaptive, those of Moffat et al. (ACM TOIS, 2017) and Jiang and Allan (CIKM, 2017), and consider the user interaction models that they give rise to. By categorizing non-relevant documents into those that are plausibly non-relevant and those that are egregiously non-relevant, we capture all of the attributes incorporated into the two proposals, and hence develop an effectiveness metric that better reflects user behavior when viewing the SERP, including bad abandonment. © 2018 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we address the problem of automatically extracting disease-symptom relationships from health question-answer forums due to its usefulness for medical question answering system. To cope with the problem, we divide our main task into two subtasks since they exhibit different challenges: (1) disease-symptom extraction across sentences, (2) disease-symptom extraction within a sentence. For both subtasks, we employed machine learning approach leveraging several hand-crafted features, such as syntactic features (i.e., information from part-of-speech tags) and pre-trained word vectors. Furthermore, we basically formulate our problem as a binary classification task, in which we classify the 'indicating' relation between a pair of Symptom and Disease entity. To evaluate the performance, we also collected and annotated corpus containing 463 pairs of question-answer threads from several Indonesian health consultation websites. Our experiment shows that, as our expected, the first subtask is relatively more difficult than the second subtask. For the first subtask, the extraction of disease-symptom relation only achieved 36% in terms of F1 measure, while the second one was 76%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing such relation extraction task for both 'across' and 'within' sentence, especially in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We address the problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) from Indonesian restaurant reviews due to its usefulness for customer satisfaction applications. The main task is divided into two subtasks: (1) aspect extraction, and (2) aspect sentiment orientation classification. For both subtasks, we propose an unsupervised approach which does not rely too much on hard-core natural language processing tools since Indonesian language is still under-resourced in terms of language technology. Our unsupervised approach employs several techniques in the area of distributional semantics, such as word embeddings and point-wise mutual information. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes a model to address the task of named-entity recognition on Indonesian microblog messages due to its usefulness for higher-level tasks or text mining applications on Indonesian microblogs. We view our task as a sequence labeling problem using machine learning approach. We also propose various word-level and orthographic features, including the ones that are specific to the Indonesian language. Finally, in our experiment, we compared our model with a baseline model previously proposed for Indonesian formal documents, instead of microblog messages. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we developed NER tool for Indonesian microblog messages, which was never addressed before, (2) we developed NER corpus containing around 600 Indonesian microblog messages available for future development. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We report several experiments on using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentence binary classification task. In terms of sentence classification, RNNs have an important advantage compared to well-known traditional machine learning models (e.g. SVM and Maximum Entropy), in which it can naturally take into account neighboring information between contiguous words. In addition, to perform binary classification task, we employed Single-Output RNNs (SORNNs) which only consists of a single output layer located in the last time step. The output layer itself is a vector consisting of two units (since we perform binary classification), in which each unit corresponds to a single label. Our results showed that SORNN achieved better performance than other traditional machine learning models, such as SVM, Maximum Entropy, and Naive Bayes, which have been widely used for sentence classification. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research discusses how natural language processing (NLP) toolkit for Indonesia formal text and social media text, named as InaNLP, has been developed. Several NLP modules were integrated into InaNLP to make people easier in building an NLP system for Indonesia language. The toolkit contains several NLP modules such as sentence splitter, tokenization, Part of Speech (POS) tagger, phrase chunker, named entity (NE) tagger, syntactic parser, semantic analyzer, and word normalization. Several NLP modules were built using rule based approach, whereas several others implemented statistical based approach. Here, the accuracy of several modules such as the POS tagger, NE tagger, syntactic parser and semantic analyzer are shown. In the NE tagger, five (5) word windows with features of POS, orthography, and word list are used. In the NE tagger experiment for evaluating the features, using SMO algorithm and 1500 sentences, for 15 NE classes, token classification accuracy of 93.419%, which outperform related work, could be achieved. For the POS tagger, using 12,000 token as the training data and 3,000 token as the testing data, the accuracy of 96.50% was achieved. For the syntactic parser, using CYK algorithm and 100 sentences as the training data and 36 sentences as the testing data, the experiment achieved the accuracy of 47.22%. For the semantic analyzer, using 200 sentences as the training data, the experiment achieved the accuracy of 62.50%. This research also shows an example in building an Indonesia NLP system using InaNLP for complaint tweet classification. In the experiment for the complaint classification, using 7440 data, the experiment achieved 0.892 of average F-measure score. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Emotion is a vital component in various Affective Computing areas such as opinion mining, sentiment analysis, e-learning applications, human-computer interaction and humor recognition. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach for detecting emotions on Indonesian tweets. In the first stage, we extract emotion-bearing tweets from a huge number of raw tweets. In the second stage, all the extracted tweets are then classified into five well-known pre-defined emotion classes, namely love, joy, sad, fear, and anger. To do that, we devise various features (i.e., linguistic, semantic, and orthographic features) and subsequently use those proposed features to build a computational model based on machine learning approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is very effective. It is also worth noting that the work described in this paper is the first work on emotion analysis on Indonesian data. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Buzzer Detection and Sentiment Analysis for Predicting Presidential Election Results in a Twitter Nation</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we present our approach for predicting the results of Indonesian Presidential Election using Twitter as our main resource. We explore the possibility of easy-togather Twitter data to be utilized as a survey supporting tool to understand public opinion. First, we collected Twitter data during the campaign period. Second, we performed automatic buzzer detection on our Twitter data to remove those tweets generated by computer bots, paid users, and fanatic users that usually become noise in our data. Third, we performed a fine-grained political sentiment analysis to partition each tweet into several sub-tweets and subsequently assigned each sub-tweet with one of the candidates and its sentiment polarity. Finally, to predict the election results, we leveraged the number of positive sub-tweets for each candidate. Our experiment shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) of our Twitter-based prediction is 0.61%, which is surprisingly better than the prediction results published by several independent survey institutions (offline polls). Our study suggests that Twitter can serve as an important resource for any political activity, specifically for predicting the final outcomes of the election itself. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The popularity of the user generated content, such as Twitter, has made it a rich source for the sentiment analysis and opinion mining tasks. This paper presents our study in automatically building a training corpus for the sentiment analysis on Indonesian tweets. We start with a set of seed sentiment corpus and subsequently expand them using a classifier model whose parameters are estimated using the Expectation and Maximization (EM) framework. We apply our automatically built corpus to perform two tasks, namely opinion tweet extraction and tweet polarity classification using various machine learning approaches. Experiment result shows that a classifier model trained on our data, which is automatically constructed using our proposed method, outperforms the baseline system in terms of opinion tweet extraction and tweet polarity classification.

	<dc:abstract>Web forums are platforms for personal communications on sharing information with others. Such information is often expressed in the form of advice. In this paper, we address the problem of advice-revealing text unit (ATU) extraction from online forums due to its usefulness in travel domain. We represent advice as a two-tuple comprising an advice-revealing sentence and its context sentences. To extract the advice-revealing sentences, we propose to define the task as a sequence labeling problem, using three different types of features: syntactic, contextual, and semantic features. To extract the context sentences, we propose to use a 2 Dimensional CRF (2D-CRF) model, which gives the best performance compared to traditional machine learning models. Finally, we present a solution to the integrated problem of extracting both advice-revealing sentences and their respective context sentences at the same time using our proposed models, i.e., Multiple Linear CRF (ML-CRF) and 2 Dimensional CRF Plus (2D-CRF+). The experimental results show that ML-CRF performs better than any other models studied in this paper for extracting advice-revealing sentences and context sentences.

	<dc:abstract>Web forums often contain explicit key learnings gleaned from people's experiences since they are platforms for personal communications on sharing information with others. One of the key learnings contained in Web forums is often expressed in the form of advice. As part of human experience mining from Web resources, we aim to provide a methodology to extract advice-revealing sentences from Web forums due to its usefulness, especially in travel domain. Instead of viewing the problem as a simple classification, we define it as a sequence labeling problem using various features. We identify three different types of features (i.e., syntactic features, context features, and sentence informativeness) and propose a new way of using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for labeling sequential sentences, which in our experiment gave the best performance for our task. Moreover, the sentence informativeness score serves as an important feature for this task.

	<dc:abstract>Here, we describe our work in developing Indonesian Mind Map Generator that employs several Indonesian natural language understanding tools as its main engine. The Indonesian Mind Map Generator1 aims to help the user in easily making a Mind Map object. The system consists of several Indonesian natural language understanding tools such as Indonesian POS Tagger, Indonesian Syntactic Parser, and Indonesian Semantic Analyzer. The methods used for developing each of Indonesian natural language understanding tools are devised to such an extend that they are enable to alleviate the low availability of Indonesian language resources. For Indonesian POS Tagger, we employed HMM and subsequently enhanced the result by using affix tree. As for the Indonesian Syntactic Parser, we compared the performance of CYK and Earley parser, which are known as common dynamic algorithms in PCFG. The Indonesian Semantic Analyzer consists of several components such as lexical semantic attachment, reference resolution, and Semantic Analyzer itself that transforms the parse tree result into first order logic representation. In our work, instead of using a rich resource on semantic information for each vocabulary, we defined several rules for the lexical semantic attachment based on POS Tags and certain words. Finally, to develop the Mind Map generator, we used the radial drawing method to visualize the first order logic representation and we also built a Mind Map editor to allow a user in modifying the Mind Map result. To evaluate the result, we conducted the experiments for each component mentioned previously. The POS Tagger accuracy achieved 96.5%, the Syntactic Parser achieved accuracy of 47.22%, and the Semantic Analyzer achieved accuracy of 62.5%. The final result of Mind Map object was evaluated by 5 respondents. The results of evaluationshowed that, for the simple sentence, the Mind Map object can be easily understood.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Weblog, one of the fastest growing user generated contents, often contains key learnings gleaned from people's past experiences which are really worthy to be well presented to other people. One of the key learnings contained in weblogs is often vented in the form of advice. In this paper, we aim to provide a methodology to extract sentences that reveal advices on weblogs. We observed our data to discover the characteristics of advices contained in weblogs. Based on this observation, we define our task as a classification problem using various linguistic features. We show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline. The presence or absence of imperative mood expression appears to be the most important feature in this task.

	<dc:abstract>In some applications, it is useful to record multiple versions of digital documents, so that we can trace the history and changes applied to the documents. The creators of the documents are often required to sign the documents to protect the origin and integrity of the documents. A typical implementation of the signature method is by using a standard signature scheme (i.e. RSA) and storing the signature along with the document. The version numbers of the documents are appended to the documents before signing. The problem is, when we need to sign many versions of the documents, the signer should create the signature of each version, which is not efficient in term of the storage. In this paper, we propose a more efficient method to sign multiple version of digital document and show the security argument of the signature scheme. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>TripTrus.Com had a high number of site visits based on data in 2017. However, the visit duration and frequency of each visitor was not promising compared to some of the site's competitors. They had longer visit duration and lower site bounce rate. This relates to stickiness, which is one of the critical success factors of e-commerce sites. To improve stickiness of TripTrus.com this research investigates its affecting factors. It took TripTrus.Com's users as respondents with purposive sampling method. The research framework was built on e-servicescape and e-commerce success model.

	<dc:abstract>Provenance of data is a documentation of the origin and processes that produce the data. Many researchers argue that the provenance should be immutable: once a provenance is submitted, it should not be changed or updated. A main reason is that the provenance represents the history of data, and the history should not be altered or changed because it represents the fact in the past. Provenance can be represented by a graph, where each node represents the process executed by a party and an edge represents the relationship between two nodes (i.e. a child node uses the outputs of the parent nodes). A method to ensure that the provenance has not been updated is by using signature chain, where the signatures of the parent nodes are recorded in the children nodes so that any changes to the parent nodes will raise inconsistencies between the parent and the children. However, sticking to the requirement that the provenance should be immutable requires unlimited data storage and also we have problems whenever we need to update the provenance for an accidental error. In this paper, we propose a method that allows updates in the signature chain-based secure provenance, while keeping the signature consistent. The main idea is by keeping the "provenance" of the provenance itself, that is the history of update of the provenance, in the form of the signatures of the previous versions of the nodes. We implement the idea by keeping the signatures of the previous version in a signature tree similar to the Merkle-tree, where the a parent node in tree is the aggregate signature of the children. Using this method, the storage requirement to store signatures is always smaller than the number of updates. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recently, there is much concern about the provenance of distributed processes, that is about the documentation of the origin and the processes to produce an object in a distributed system. The provenance has many applications in the forms of medical records, documentation of processes in the computer systems, recording the origin of data in the cloud, and also documentation of human-executed processes. The provenance of distributed processes can be modeled by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node represents an entity, and an edge represents the origin and causal relationship between entities. Without sufficient security mechanisms, the provenance graph suffers from integrity and confidentiality problems, for example changes or deletions of the correct nodes, additions of fake nodes and edges, and unauthorized accesses to the sensitive nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose an integrity mechanism for provenance graph using the digital signature involving three parties: the process executors who are responsible in the nodes' creation, a provenance owner that records the nodes to the provenance store, and a trusted party that we call the Trusted Counter Server (TCS) that records the number of nodes stored by the provenance owner. We show that the mechanism can detect the integrity problem in the provenance graph, namely unauthorized and malicious "authorized" updates even if all the parties, except the TCS, collude to update the provenance. In this scheme, the TCS only needs a very minimal storage (linear with the number of the provenance owners). To protect the confidentiality and for an efficient access control administration, we propose a method to encrypt the provenance graph that allows access by paths and compartments in the provenance graph. We argue that encryption is important as a mechanism to protect the provenance data stored in an untrusted environment. We analyze the security of the integrity mechanism, and perform experiments to measure the performance of both mechanisms. © 2012 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Proxy re-encryption is a useful concept and many proxy re-encryption schemes have been proposed in the asymmetric encryption setting. In the asymmetric encryption setting, proxy re-encryption can be beautifully implemented because many operations are available to directly transform a cipher to another cipher without the proxy needs to access the plaintexts. However, in many situations, for a better performance, the data is encrypted using symmetric ciphers. Most symmetric ciphers do not support proxy cryptography because of malleability (that is needed to implement the proxy re-encryption) is not a desired property in a secure encryption scheme. In this paper, we suggest an idea to implement a pure proxy re-encryption for the symmetric ciphers by first transforming the plaintext into a random sequence of blocks using an All or nothing transform (AONT). We show an example of the proxy re-encryption scheme using a weak encryption (i.e. simple permutation) that has a simple conversion function to convert a permutation to another. The encryption scheme exploits three characteristics of an AONT transformation: (1) the output of an AONT is a pseudorandom, (2) the output of an AONT cannot be transformed back if any parts is missing, and (3) the output of an AONT cannot be transformed back without having all blocks with correct position. We show security argument of the proposed scheme and its performance evaluation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes how to preserve integrity and confidentiality of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model of provenance database. We show a method to preserve integrity by using digital signature where both of the provenance owner and the process executors (i.e. contributors) sign the nodes and the relationships between nodes in the provenance graph so that attacks to integrity can be detected by checking the signatures. To preserve confidentiality of the nodes and edges in the provenance graph we propose an access control model based on paths on the provenance graph because an auditor who need to audit a result normally need to access all nodes that have causal relationship with the result (i.e. all nodes that have a path to the result). We also complement the path-based access control with a compartment-based access control where each node is classified into compartments and the auditor is not allowed to access the nodes included in a compartment that can not be accessed by him/her (because of the sensitivity of the compartment). We implement the path-based access control by encrypting the nodes and later store encrypted encryption's keys in the children of the nodes. The compartment-based access control is implemented by encrypting the nodes in different compartments with different keys. We developed a prototype of the model and performed experiments to measure the overhead of digital signature and the double encryptions. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Provenance is defined in some literature as a complete documentation of process that led to an object. Provenance has been utilized in some contexts, i.e. database systems, file systems and grid systems. Provenance can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this paper we show an access control method to the provenance information that is represented by a directed acyclic graph and a method to improve efficiency of access control by grouping the provenance information. The idea of our model is that by controlling access to nodes, edges and paths in the provenance graph we may build an expressive access control model to the provenance graph. We improve the efficiency of access control model by grouping some provenance information. In our model, the provenance information is stored in a relational database. Before explaining our idea, we describe provenance store, provenance representation, and how to store provenance graph in a relational database. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we compare four risk analysis methods: Mehari, Magerit, NIST800-30 and Microsoft's Security Management Guide. Mehari is a method for risk analysis and risk management developed by CLUSIF (Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français). Magerit is a risk analysis and management methodology for information systems developed by CSAE (Consejo Superior de Administración Electrónica). NIST800-30 is a risk management guide for information technology systems recommended by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) in NIST Special Publication 800-30. Microsoft's Security Management Guide is a security risk management guide developed by Microsoft. In this paper, we compare those methods based on two main criteria: the first criterion is the steps that are used by the methods to conduct the risk assessment, the second one is the contents of the methods and supplementary documents provided with them. We found that all methods follow the first three general steps of risk analysis. However, the Mehari method, the Magerit method and the Microsoft Security Management Guide do not include control recommendations. Control recommendations in these methods are proposed as the next step to security management (i.e. after risk analysis). All methods provide a detailed guide for risk analysis. However, only three methods - Mehari, Magerit and the one proposed in the Microsoft Security Management Guide-provide supplementary documents for risk assessment. © 2009 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The zoning policy of Indonesia New Student Admission System encourages schools to accept more students from their zoning location. This condition needs to be supported by a good management to ensure that the school facilities suffice the student distribution. School location-allocation optimization problem aims to obtain optimum student distribution such that the total of students travel distance is minimized. This problem is modeled as p-median problem, and can be solved using meta-heuristic approach. In this study, firefly algorithm with two-dimensional firefly individual representation is utilized to solve South Jakarta junior school location-allocation problem. The obtained solution lowers 57.58% of student travel distance compared to the previous condition assuming that favorite schools are tend to be chosen by students. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>DEM (Digital Elevation Model) as a digital model of the earth's surface elevation could be generated from remote sensing technology such as stereo imaging for various applications. To generate DEM from stereo imagery, interpolation or approximation process stage is required. Stochastic interpolation e.g. ordinary kriging uses semivariogram fitting to calculate weights of interpolation values based on known points. This research is applying regression types of machine learning for semivariogram fitting to interpolate DEM. Previous research conducted was LS-SVM (Least Square-Support Vector Machine) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) for semivariogram fitting process. Types of SVM and GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) are adopted for semivariogram fitting for ordinary kriging interpolation in this experiment. The result showed that in general SVM types could predict accuracy better than other types of regression, and GPR types produce better DEM accuracy based on the experiment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>DEM as a model of earth's surface model plays an important role in the environmental analysis. The most common recent technology in producing DEM is SAR. Even though it has advantages compared to optical approach, DEM generated from SAR still has issues regarding process setting regarding cross-correlation and spatial resolution determination. Both aspects will affect the volume of output data and computational effort. This research project is aimed to analyze the effects of cross-correlation and spatial resolution determination in DEM generation process to its accuracy. Several experiment scenarios of cross-correlation and spatial resolution setting had been applied to TerraSAR-X data. Overall output is shown that determination of cross-correlation threshold and spatial resolution in processing stages will have a significant effect on the accuracy of DEM generated. Gaps of data often occur in several sets of both aspects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper is intended to make a breakthrough in argumentation mining field. Current trends in argumentation mining research use handcrafted features and traditional machine learning (e.g., support vector machine). We worked on two tasks: identifying argument components and recognising insufficiently supported arguments. We utilise deep learning approach and implement attention mechanism on top of it to gain the best result. We do also implement Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) in this task. HAN is a neural network that gives attention to two levels, which are word-level and sentence-level. Deep learning with attention mechanism models can achieve better result compared with other deep learning methods. This paper also proves that on research task with hierarchically-structured data, HAN will perform remarkably well. We do present our result on using XGBoost instead of a regular non-ensemble classifier as well. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Objectives: Polysomnography is essential to diagnose sleep disorders. It is used to identify a patient’s sleep pattern during sleep. This pattern is obtained by a doctor or health practitioner by using a scoring process, which is time consuming. To overcome this problem, we developed a system that can automatically classify sleep stages. Methods: This paper proposes a new method for sleep stage classification, called the fast convolutional method. The proposed method was evaluated against two sleep datasets. The first dataset was obtained from physionet.org, a physiologic signals data centers. Twenty-five patients who had a sleep disorder participated in this data collection. The second dataset was collected in Mitra Keluarga Kemayoran Hospital, Indonesia. Data was recorded from ten healthy respondents. Results: The proposed method reached 73.50% and 56.32% of the F-measures for the PhysioNet and Mitra Keluarga Kemayoran Hospital data, respectively. Both values were the highest among all the machine learning methods considered in this study. The proposed method also had an efficient running time. The fast convolutional models of the PhysioNet and Mitra Keluarga Kemayoran Hospital data needed 42.60 and 0.06 seconds, respectively. Conclusions: The fast convolutional method worked well on the tested datasets. It achieved a high F-measure result and an efficient running time. Thus, it can be considered a promising tool for sleep stage classification. © 2018 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Elevation of earth surface can be modeled into several forms, i.e. height points, contour, Digital Elevation Model (DEM). DEM as a continuous type of elevation data is generated mainly from height point data. The accuracy of DEM depends on many factors; which one of them is the level of sampling density of the height point used as the input of interpolation processing. Height point itself can be generated from various remote sensing technologies. Stereo optical is very common nowadays in producing DEM data. Spatial resolution or pixel size specification of the stereo optical image might effect on the level of sampling density of height point generated. This research is aimed to analyze the influence of different sampling density generated from some optical stereo images and its pixel size in generating DEM as a model of continuous elevation. The experiment is using three types of optical stereo data which has different sampling density and spatial resolution. The result is shown that the more sampling density the more accurate DEM generated, and the more detail pixel size the more accurate DEM generated. Meanwhile, two data with the same pixel size might significantly produce a different accuracy of DEM. It can be caused by another factor such as input data errors and processing stage errors. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Shoreline is a boundary area between land and sea, where there are few phenomena that unique and dynamic. This phenomenon includes abrasion erosion and sedimentation. Development of infrastructure and reclamation is human action that can alter the ecosystem as well as the order of the shoreline. Observation shoreline is a field that is very useful for Indonesia because Indonesia is an archipelagic country consisting of many islands. Danger from the sea could come at any time and could be very dangerous for human life, so it is important to observe, to monitor and to maintain the shoreline. This study used Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification method, and Principal Component Analysis of the band images and Histogram of Oriented Gradient as feature extraction for shape features. Multi temporal Landsat will be consist of Landsat 5 acquired in 1996 and Landsat 8 acquired in 2016. The result of this study shown that 85% of shoreline in 2016 changed after applied image enhancement compared to shoreline in year of 1996. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Land cover represents characteristics of earth surface. By utilizing the abundance of geotagged images from online crowdsource images like Geotagged photo library (http://eomf.ou.edu/nhotosi from the University of Oklahoma, prediction of land cover types will be established by using machine learning techniques. RGB Histogram, Edge Orientation and Vegetation Indices were used to obtain 8 features that representing images, therefore several classifiers were performed to observe which of classifiers produce best accuracy. Best classifier then used to predict unclassified images. The result, Random Forest classifier produces 82% in overall validation accuracy and 89% of 74 unclassified images was successfully predicted comparing with expert prediction result The last, 74 of successful predicted images were mapped into Geographic Information System (GIS) to show land cover in GIS. This model was measured by using precision, recall, F-Test and Kappa Coefficient The performance of each measurement reaches 89.8%, 88.1%, 88.6%, 85.6% respectively. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Classification of sleep stage is very useful to detect the occurrence of sleep apnea. This classification requires mechanisms that automatically and efficiently process polysomnography data. However, the process requires a system to be able to extract the relevant features which are then used to classify the sleep stage. The best solution is sequence classification because it not only concerns the contents of each segment or the sequence of data. One of the best order-based identifiers today is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM can only update for forwarding directions. To process the data in two directions, it implemented Bidirectional Longs Short Term Memory (Bi-STM). Also, the implementation also applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a feature learning before using Bi-LSTM. The result shows that F-measure Bi-LSTM is better than LSTM but use CNN as a learning attribute for Bi-LSTM cause an F-measure decrease. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Immunization and vaccination are very important for infant and toddler. The management system for registration in formal institution is not built yet. To overcome this problem, infant and toddler recognition using fingerprint can be chosen to identify infant and toddler. In this paper, we proposed a telebiometric system for infant and toddler recognition. The proposed system has three main components, namely sensor, mobile phone or PC, and server. The system used some feature extraction methods, such as ridge period, singular point, and minutiae, as fingerprint features to match it with the database data. The result showed that the system has 0.82 accuracy and 321 ms average running time. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Fundus image texture features analysis in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>This paper investigates texture feature capabilities from fundus images to differentiate between diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) screening and normal. Our proposed method using improvement of local binary pattern (LBP) with calculation of LBP original value and magnitude value of fundus images. This method is compared with Local Line Binary Pattern (LLBP). In this study, four experiments (DR-Normal, DR-AMD, AMD-Normal, Multiclass) were designed for two databases, DIARETDB0 database and STARE. Kernel PCA is choosed as feature selection method, and three classifiers are tested (Naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN). The experimental results show that our proposed method has higher accuracy than LLBP, with accuracy of binary classification 100% for DR-Normal and AMD-Normal. While, multiclass classification (DR-AMD-Normal) achieves an accuracy 80-84%. These results suggest that our proposed method in this paper can be useful in a diagnosis aid system for diabetic retinopathy. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research uses feature representation with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) as a final classifier. Feature learning is performed after feature extraction and aims to get the optimal represented feature. The feature representation mechanism is required as a pre-process for Bi-LSTM because Bi-LSTM is not reliable when directly processing raw data or feature extraction results. The focus of the research is to investigate the influence of cluster number of Fuzzy Clustering on Bi-LSTM performance. Specifically, the study examined the proposed method of sleep stage classification in which the data used were polysomnogram. From the testing result, it's found that increasing the number of clusters tends to increase the performance of sleep stage classification. Experiments using nine groups at the feature representation stage have the highest performance with the value of F-measure of 72.75%. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The enactment of zoning policy on Indonesia New Student Admission System requires schools to accept students only from its zone. This condition needs management of school allocation to ensure the facilities suffice the student distribution. Optimization of school location-allocation aims to obtain optimal allocation such that the students travel cost is minimized. This problem can be modelled as p-median problem, and it can be solved using metaheuristic approach. This study utilized genetic algorithm with two-dimensional individual representation to solve junior school location-allocation problem in South Jakarta. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm lowers 40.55% of student travel cost compared to the previous allocation with assumption that students tend to choose favorite schools in the center of regency. © Proceedings of 2018 the 8th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2018.

	<dc:abstract>DEM as a representation of the earth's surface has many functions for spatial analysis. DEM can be produced from several kinds of techniques such as satellite technology stereo optical or radar technology. Problems when using the optical stereo data is at the high point density level that is not distributed evenly. In regions with homogeneous character, the height point is becoming sparse. This will affect to DEM accuracy. In order to solve the problem, performing fusion techniques using interpolation method cokriging involving data points ALOS PRISM and SRTM height point was conducted. The sparse height point derived from ALOS PRISM on some object is expected to be enhanced by using SRTM data. There were several aspects to enhance the accuracy of DEM-derived from this process: the character of topography, land cover types, density in height point of the data and the precise type of interpolation method used. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

In this paper, we report the comparison between fast-feature pyramids and deep region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) to detect a person in surveillance images. Since RCNN performs better in detecting a person, further training is applied to the RCNN to detect man and woman. Transfer learning strategy is used due to a small number of training images.

	<dc:abstract>The need for segmentation and labeling of sequence data appears in several fields. The use of the conditional models such as Conditional Random Fields is widely used to solve this problem. In the pattern recognition, Conditional Random Fields specify the possibilities of a sequence label. This method constructs its full label sequence to be a probabilistic graphical model based on its observation. However, Conditional Random Fields can not capture the internal structure so that Latent-based Dynamic Conditional Random Fields is developed without leaving external dynamics of inter-label. This study proposes the use of Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields for Gesture Recognition and comparison between both methods. Besides, this study also proposes the use of a scalar features to gesture recognition. The results show that performance of Latent-dynamic based Conditional Random Fields is not better than the Conditional Random Fields, and scalar features are effective for both methods are in gesture recognition. Therefore, it recommends implementing Conditional Random Fields and scalar features in gesture recognition for better performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Data mining approach can be used to discover knowledge by analyzing the patterns or correlations among of fields in large databases. Data mining approach was used to find the patterns of the data from Tanzania Ministry of Water. It is used to predict current and future status of water pumps in Tanzania. The data mining method proposed is XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). XGBoost implement the concept of Gradient Tree Boosting which designed to be highly fast, accurate, efficient, flexible, and portable. In addition, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is also proposed to select the important features of the data to obtain an accurate model. The best accuracy achieved with using 27 input factors selected by RFE and XGBoost as a learning model. The achieved result show 80.38% in accuracy. The information or knowledge which is discovered from data mining approach can be used by the government to improve the inspection planning, maintenance, and identify which factor that can cause damage to the water pumps to ensure the availability of potable water in Tanzania. Using data mining approach is cost-effective, less time consuming and faster than manual inspection. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In 2015, stroke was the number one cause of death in Indonesia. The majority type of stroke is ischemic. The standard tool for diagnosing stroke is CT-Scan. For developing countries like Indonesia, the availability of CT-Scan is very limited and still relatively expensive. Because of the availability, another device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so that the EEG signal have a deceleration. On this study, we perform the ability of ID Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) to construct classification model that can distinguish the EEG and EOG stroke data from EEG and EOG control data. To accelerate training process our model we use Batch Normalization. Involving 62 person data object and from leave one out the scenario with five times repetition of measurement we obtain the average of accuracy 0.86 (F-Score 0.861) only at 200 epoch. This result is better than all over shallow and popular classifiers as the comparator (the best result of accuracy 0.69 and F-Score 0.72). The feature used in our study were only 24 handcrafted feature with simple feature extraction process. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most prominent architectures and algorithm in Deep Learning. It shows a remarkable improvement in the recognition and classification of objects. This method has also been proven to be very effective in a variety of computer vision and machine learning. As in other deep learning, however, training this approach is interesting yet challenging. Recently, some metaheuristic algorithms have been used to optimize CNN using Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Harmony Search. In this paper, another type of metaheuristic algorithms with different strategy has been proposed, i.e. Microcanonical Annealing to optimize Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of the proposed method is tested using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Although experiment results of MNIST dataset indicate the increase in computation time (1.02x-1.38x), nevertheless this proposed method can considerably enhance the performance of the original CNN (up to 4.60%). On the CIFAR10 dataset, currently, state of the art is 96.53% using fractional pooling, while this proposed method achieves 99.14%. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Number of maternal and infant mortality in Indonesia is high. This problem can be minimized by monitoring the fetal condition via ultrasound image. In addition, Indonesia have small number of obstetrics and gynecology compare to number of its population. Moreover, it is centralized in urban areas, so it is hard to monitor the condition of every babies in Indonesia. In order to resolve this problem, we have built fetal head monitoring system. Part of the system is to segment the fetal head in ultrasound image. In this paper, we examine nature optimization such as bat algorithm, cuckoo search, and flower pollination algorithm for optimizing Gaussian elliptical path for automatic fetal head segmentation. Experiment results shows that nature optimization Based Gaussian elliptical path (DoGEII-FPA and DoGEII-CS) has a minimum error compared to Gaussian elliptical path (DoGEll) which is optimized by Nelder-Mead. Interestingly, DoGEll-FPA and DoGEll-CS perform well from DoGEll-NM in different image. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Retail industry growth in Indonesia is considered significant and will continue, related to Indonesian lifestyle changes. One of the important things to consider is location determination. The complexity of the location determination problem for the development of a business requires a comprehensive decision support system, using relevant data and appropriate technology so that it can accommodate a variety of data formats and information. This paper described the spatial pattern analysis approach to discover patterns of fast food restaurants. ArcGIS Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I) tool was used to find evidence that the fast food restaurant distribution in Jakarta, as the biggest city in Indonesia, has a clustered pattern and were not the result of random chance. The clustered pattern was investigated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify the clustered area of fast food restaurant. © 2018 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Fast and Optimal Visual Tracking based on Spectral Method</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Visual object tracking is the process of continuously localizing visual object in a video sequence. We would like to investigate the problem of short-term model-free tracking which the main purpose is to track any object just based on an annotation box of object. Many factors affect the performance of the tracking algorithm. In the Visual Tracker Benchmark, there are eleven challenges in object tracking. There has not been a single tracker that successfully handles all of these scenarios. In addition, the tracker must be fast enough to be useful in real applications. We propose a new tracking algorithm within the Bayesian framework. The proposed algorithm is constructed by solving optimally particle filters (OPF) efficiently using spectral methods. Therefore, the constructed tracker is called as Spectral Tracker (ST). Although ST can efficiently compute object position, it cannot estimate the scale and rotation directly. To overcome this weakness, it is proposed to use multiple observation points simultaneously and to use information on the observation point movement to estimate scale and rotation. In the experiments, the performance of ST tracker was compared with 9 relevant trackers based on 100 data sets. The experimental results on on tracker performance show that increasing performance especially in tracker precision and success rate. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we propose the empirical analysis of Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) as a feature extractor that works conjointly with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as the classifier to recognize insufficiently supported arguments using a publicly available dataset. Besides HAN + XGBoost, we performed experiments with several other deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU. All results with the best hyper-parameters are presented. In this paper, we present the following three key findings: (1) Shallow models work significantly better than the deep models when using only a small dataset. (2) Attention mechanism can improve the deep model’s result. In average, it improves Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC) score of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a margin of 18.94%. The hierarchical attention network gave a higher ROC-AUC score by 2.25% in comparison to the non-hierarchical one. (3) The use of XGBoost as the replacement for the last fully connected layer improved the F1 macro score by 5.26%. Overall our best setting achieves 1.88% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art result. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A person with sleep disorder such as apnea will stop breathing for a while during sleep. If frequently occurs, sleep disorder is dangerous for health. An early step for diagnosing apnea is by classifying the sleep stages during sleep. This study explores some shallow classifiers and their feasibility applied to sleep data. Recently, a sleep stages classification system that use deep unsupervised features learning representations have been proposed [9]. In our view, an adequate study on this problem using shallow classifiers still need to be investigated. This study, using some of the data on [9], focuses on evaluating some shallow classifier to the sleep stages classification problem. This study evaluates five classifiers: SVM, Neural Network, Classification Tree, k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN), and Naive Bayes. Experiment result shows that neural network gives best performance for sleep stage classification problem. Compared to the SVM (the 2-nd rank of accuracy on S000 data), the neural network is also more efficient than SVM in term of computational time and memory requirement. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A typical modern optimization technique is usually either heuristic or metaheuristic. This technique has managed to solve some optimization problems in the research area of science, engineering, and industry. However, implementation strategy of metaheuristic for accuracy improvement on convolution neural networks (CNN), a famous deep learning method, is still rarely investigated. Deep learning relates to a type of machine learning technique, where its aim is to move closer to the goal of artificial intelligence of creating a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual tasks that can be carried out by a human. In this paper, we propose the implementation strategy of three popular metaheuristic approaches, that is, simulated annealing, differential evolution, and harmony search, to optimize CNN. The performances of these metaheuristic methods in optimizing CNN on classifying MNIST and CIFAR dataset were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, the proposed methods are also compared with the original CNN. Although the proposed methods show an increase in the computation time, their accuracy has also been improved (up to 7.14 percent). © 2016 L. M. Rasdi Rere et al.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The main problem in face recognition system based on half-face pattern is how to anticipate poses and illuminance variations to improve recognition rate. To solve this problem, we can use two lenses on stereo vision camera in face recognition system. Stereo vision camera has left and right lenses that can be used to produce a 2D image of each lens. Stereo vision camera in face recognition has capability to produce two of 2D face images with a different angle. Both angle of the face image will produce a detailed image of the face and better lighting levels on each of the left and right lenses. In this study, we proposed a face recognition technique, using 2 lens on a stereo vision camera namely symmetrical half-join. Symmetrical half-join is a method of normalizing the image of the face detection on each of the left and right lenses in stereo vision camera, then cropping and merging at each image. Tests on face recognition rate based on the variety of poses and variations in illumination shows that the symmetrical half-join method is able to provide a high accuracy of face recognition and can anticipate variations in given pose and illumination variations. The proposed model is able to produce 86%-97% recognition rate on a variety of poses and variations in angles between 0°-22.5°. The variation of illuminance measured using a lux meter can result in 90%-100% recognition rate for the category of at least dim lighting levels (above 10 lux).

	<dc:abstract>Purpose: This paper aims to recommend implementation of the knowledge management (KM) strategy for a mental health organisation, an area that has, to date, limited attention in literature based on the factors that influence KM success. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods research was conducted to identify the organisational culture, resources, enablers and the influential factors of mental health knowledge management (MHKM). The data were collected in five referral mental hospitals and were analysed using quantitative, qualitative and triangulation methods. Findings: The organisational culture has become a great barrier. Forty-three influential factors were identified. Otherwise, based on culture, resources, enablers and strengthen, weakness, opportunities and threaten (SWOT) analysed were adopted to propose ten of the critical success factors and were recommended into an implementation strategy. Research limitations/implications: The paper has proven that KM is a new and emerging discipline in Indonesia, especially on mental health care. This will contribute to the governmental policy of KM implementation and enforce the quality of services. Practical implications: This result has the potential to leverage interdisciplinary KM research. It supports a mental health organisation in applying KM. Originality/value: This study is probably the first to analyse factors that are of influence in an MHKM initiative programme. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper systematically investigates the effect of image texture features on batik motif retrieval performance. The retrieval process uses a query motif image to find matching motif images in a database. In this study, feature fusion of various image texture features such as Gabor, Log-Gabor, Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrices (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are attempted in motif image retrieval. With regards to performance evaluation, both individual features and fused feature sets are applied. Experimental results show that optimal feature fusion outperforms individual features in batik motif retrieval. Among the individual features tested, Log-Gabor features provide the best result. The proposed approach is best used in a scenario where a query image containing multiple basic motif objects is applied to a dataset in which retrieved images also contain multiple motif objects. The retrieval rate achieves 84.54% for the rank 3 precision when the feature space is fused with Gabor, GLCM and Log-Gabor features. The investigation also shows that the proposed method does not work well for a retrieval scenario where the query image contains multiple basic motif objects being applied to a dataset in which the retrieved images only contain one basic motif object.

	<dc:abstract>Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the powerful optimization methods. Performance of this algorithm is significantly relying on its parameter setting. These parameters are usually constant during the entire search process. However to set them accurately is not easy and totally depends on the problem characteristic. To address this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed to automatically fine-tune the parameters, according to feature of the problem. In this paper we evaluated two variations of adaptive DE for application of optimal image Contrast Enhancement. The first method was DE using chaotic sequences and the second was DE based on random adjustment of the parameters. The objective of both variations in this application is to increase the fitness criterion with the aim of enhance the contrast and details of the image. The results are compared with classical DE by four testing images, i.e. Cameraman, Lena, Boat, and Rice. The simulation results show that, applications of these variations adaptive DE in image contrast enhancement are potential approach to increase the performance of classical DE. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Characteristic of sperm movement or sperm motility is one of important quality of sperm. Computer-aided Sperm Analysis (CASA) systems have attempted to give more accurate information about sperm motility. For collecting a single good sperm in Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) procedures, achieving correct sperm trajectory is necessary. On the other hand, visual tracking of a sperm is a challenging issue because: (i) sperms have similar size and shape, (ii) a good sperm moves fast and has unpredictable motions. Furthermore, our sperm videos were taken by regular cameras which have low frame rate (about 20 fps), which cause the sperm-motion more abrupt. To address this problem, we propose searching driven stochastic sampling framework for visual tracking of abrupt motions. In here, searching algorithm will give promising regions of the target, and thus can replace the role of transition model in tracking system. For searching, we employ Coherency Sensitive Hashing (CSH) in a window to constrain search space in each frame, called as Search Window. And then for stochastic sampling framework, we adopt Smoothing Stochastic Approximate Monte Carlo (SSAMC) to specifically finding the target. The experimental results on human-sperm sequences show that: (i) comparing to our previous tracker which use geometric transition dynamic model, the proposed tracker can handle abrupt motions robustly, (ii) by using appropriate Search Window, the tracker can localize the sperm target and restrict observation of other similar sperms. © 2015 The Authors.

	<dc:abstract>Deep learning (DL) is a new area of research in machine learning, in which the objective is moving us closer to the goal of artificial intelligent. This method can learn many levels of abstraction and representation to create a common sense of data such as text, sound and image. Although DL is useful for a variety of tasks, it's hard to train. Some methods in training deep learning to make it optimal have been proposed, including Stochastic Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient, Hessian-free optimization, and Krylov Subspace Descent. In this paper, we proposed Simulated Annealing (SA) to improve the performance of Convolution Neural Network (CNN), as an alternative approach for optimal DL using modern optimization technique, i.e. metaheuristic algorithm. MNIST dataset is used to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, we also compare our proposed method with the original of CNN. Although there is an increase in computation time, the experiment results show that the proposed method can improve the performance of original CNN. © 2015 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In e-Livestock management system, practical and accurate cattle race identification is paramount. This paper presents a cattle race identification system from their images. We propose a deep learning architecture, which is called as Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix Convolutional Neural Networks (GLCM-CNN), to semi-unsupervisedly identify a cattles race given thousands of its images with complex background settings. We introduce and evaluate GLCM features, i.e., contrast, energy, and homogeneity into CNN learning for GLCMs capability to recognize pattern with diverse variations, robustness to geometric distortion, and simple transformation. Our experiments show that GLCM-CNN is gives higher classification accuracy and requires less number of learning iterations than the original CNN. In our approach, the data input layer has better distinguishing features than the original image. In addition, our method does not require any prior segmentation process. In this paper, we also address the reduction of computation overhead using saliency maps. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Batik is a traditional clothwith unique patterns applied to fabric using a wax-resist dyeing technique. Aside from preserving this rich cultural heritage, the automated recognition of Batik patterns would enable many interesting applications. This paper introduces an approach to batik pattern recognition using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) as a feature extraction method. The challenging issues that arise are due to the highly symmetrical and repetitive properties of batik patterns. The Hough transform, as an evidence-based method of object detection, is applied to handle mismatched keypoints resulting from symmetrical and repetitive patterns of batik. On a collection of 120 batik images generated from 20 basic batik patterns, the proposed method showsan improvement over the original SIFT matching method with an equal error rate of 8.47%. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Until now, designing a reliable image segmentation algorithm is still an open problem. Research related to this matter is still underway, but in one occasion we may be faced with the problem for selection image segmentation algorithms that will we use? To get the solution of this problem we need a good technical evaluation of image segmentation algorithms. With the technique, it is expected we can finally choose and use the right image segmentation algorithm. Pixel matching (Pm) an image segmentation algorithm evaluation techniques are common but considered less complete and does not support the refinement aspects evaluation. In this study we present two techniques for the evaluation of the segmentation algorithm: Local Consistency Error (LCE) and boundary matching. Furthermore both of techniques will use for evaluate segmentation algorithms based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a variety of simple features. In addition, as a comparison, k-mean will used as the base segmentation technique. From the experimental result showed that in general segmentation algorithm using SVM produces a better accuracy than k-means. The highest accuracy is obtained when the value is used as the SVM as classifier and Hue Saturate Value (HSV) as a feature. Sequentially evaluation value obtained was 90. 614% (Pm), 0.106 (LCE), and the highest value of precision and recall for matching boundary are 0.419 and 0.721 (when radius = 5 pixels). © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

With three scenarios (training set as testing set, leave one out, and 3-fold cross validation) using conventional decision tree (ID3) the accuracy level reach 97.14%, 40%, and 51.51% respectively. On the other hand, using spatial decision tree (SDT) the accuracy reach level 97.14%, 54.29%, and 54.28%. Based on the accuracy level and the structure of tree that was constructed, SDT produce better result. These facts will imply that quality level of public junior high schools on Bogor have correlation with characteristics of geographic area. However, SDT need much more computation time to construct decision tree rather than ID3, so for big number of data and big number of attributes, SDT will not appropriate. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>e-Livestock has become a new paradigm in e-Government, especially in Indonesia. Research on e-Livestock was started since 2010 and continues until today. In 2013, a web-based system has been successfully made to implement e-Livestock in Indonesia. The system was named 'Sistem e-Livestock Indonesia'. The system can be used to collect important data about the condition of cows in Indonesia, so that it can be very useful in decision making. However, that system only has been tested in one province and has not been massively adopted in Indonesia. Thus, to demonstrate the real benefits of the system, the system is equipped with several Decision Support System (DSS) modules. The results of all DSS modules are shown spatially in the Geographical Information System (GIS), so that making it easier for the government officials to make decisions. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The development of research in the field of real-time face recognition is a study that is being developed in the last decade. Face recognition is used to identify person from an image or video. Recognition rate and computation time of real-time face recognition is one of the big challenges that must be developed. This study proposes a model of face recognition using the method of feature extraction by combining three level wavelet decomposition and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and using the method of mahalanobis distance for the classification section (3WPCA-MD). A 3-level wavelet decomposition is used to decompose images by reducing the resolution used for those images. Using wavelet decomposition up to level 3 will produce an image with a very low resolution so as to reduce the value of the resulting computation time to be processed using PCA. Mahalanobis distance method is used to determine the degree of similarity among the features to produce a more optimal face recognition. Based on the results of experiments that have been done, they generated improved face recognition with high face recognition accuracy of up to 96% in average and produced faster computation results of face recognition if compared to ordinary PCA method. The average computation speed value obtained using the method of 3WPCA-MD was 5-7 milli-second (ms) for each face recognition process. © 2014 Science Publications.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays taking a photo from smartphones is widely popular because of their simplicity and convenience, but the images from them sometimes suffer from illumination and color distortion, so an enhancement of these images are necessary. There are many kind of image enhancement have been proposed. One of them using metaheuristic. In this paper we pursue efficient metaheuristic algorithms for optimal image contrast enhancement for smartphone-photo. Several smartphone-photos and image from benchmark data are used to evaluate the algorithms. The simulation results show metaheuristic methods are a possible efficient scheme to increase the quality of contrasting from smartphone-photo. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a unified framework for recognizing and scoring dance motion using 2-layer classifier so that computation complexity is distributed into two layers. This research examines the performance of sliding window, hidden Markov Model (HMM) and conditional random field (CRF) as the first layer classifier to segment the input video into a sequence of motion primitive label. The second layer classifier is stochastic error-correcting context-free grammar, built based on dance master knowledge, to parse the sequence of labels, builds a parse tree, and computes the accumulated dance score. The dataset for this research is captured using one Kinect camera. The training dataset is: 212 samples of 12 motion primitive samples and seven videos of Pendet dance performance. From 5-fold cross-validation, accuracy of sliding window, HMM, and CRF are 0.63, 0.79, and 0.86 respectively. This result shows that CRF achieves higher performance as a dance motion primitive recognizer than HMM as proposed by [1]. The CRF model achieves 0.88 of accuracy when motion feature is all skeleton joint angular coordinates as proposed by [2] but increases to 0.93 if the motion feature is only upper-body joint coordinates. Stochastic error-correcting context-free grammar is chosen as dance choreography model. The experiment using synthetic sequence label with cost factor ci=1 and error-sequence labels up to 50 percent shows the grammar can tolerate the input label sequence error up to 25 percent. The experiment using Pendet dance performances show that the average dance score is 79.3. The low dance score is due to several factors including: dance skill variation, unstable basic gesture repetition, high cost contributed by replacing deletion and substitution of local error by insertion operation, duration variation due the absence of timing guideline of body part motions, and limited training dataset to capture possible basic gesture variations. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Conventionally, Fundamental Diagrams, which consist of vehicle traffic flow and density pairs, are obtained from intrusive sensor such as inductive loop detectors. However these sensors are uncommon in developing countries as they are embedded in the roads, and consequently expensive to deploy and impractical to implement on busy roads. Our novel method, VDZ with CCTV snap shots can provide the data needed to construct Fundamental Diagrams and able to show zero speeds at jam density, which provide essential parameters for macroscopic traffic model. The results obtained, without the use of any intrusive sensor, have shown agreement with previous traditional method. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we proposed the implementation of 3D Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm to a multi-lead ECG signal compression. The implementation of 3D SPIHT decorrelates three types of redundancy that commonly found on a multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal i.e. intra-beat, inter-beat, and inter-lead redundancies. To optimize overall compression performance we also proposed beat reordering and residual calculation technique. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. This rearrangement reduces variances between adjacent beats so that the 2D ECG array contains less high frequency component. Residual calculation optimizes required storage usage further by minimizing amplitude variance of 2D ECG array. The experiments on selected records from St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database show that proposed method gives relatively low distortion at compression rate 8 and 16. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The research of face recognition and face distance estimation is a study that is being developed nowadays. This research proposes a model of face recognition by combining wavelet decomposition, PCA and Mahalanobis distance. This method will provide a better of recognition rate and will improve the computation time of face recognition. We also develop the measurement of distance between the face and the camera on the proposed face recognition system. We propose real-time distance estimation on face recognition system using stereo vision camera. We calculate the distance using stereo vision camera based on stereo triangulation method using two lenses. The two lenses of stereo vision camera are used to capture a face image and to determine the 3 dimensional points projected from 2 dimensional points. The calculation of distance is determined by the projection from stereo vision camera. The proposed system is capable to calculate the distance beetween face and camera on the proposed of face recognition. This research also suggests a correlation between recognition rate and the distance estimation beetween face and camera. The recognition rate of the proposed of face recognition can work well in the range of 50-350 cm in real-time conditions. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT &amp; LLS. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Scene classification based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a more general modeling method known as a bag of visual words, in which the construction of a visual vocabulary is a crucial quantization process to ensure success of the classification. A framework is developed using the following new aspects: Gaussian mixture clustering for the quantization process, the use of an integrated visual vocabulary (IVV), which is built as the union of all centroids obtained from the separate quantization process of each class, and the usage of some features, including edge orientation histogram, CIELab color moments, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The experiments are conducted on IKONOS images with six semantic classes (tree, grassland, residential, commercial/industrial, road, and water). The results show that the use of an IVV increases the overall accuracy (OA) by 11 to 12% and 6% when it is implemented on the selected and all features, respectively. The selected features of CIELab color moments and GLCM provide a better OA than the implementation over CIELab color moment or GLCM as individuals. The latter increases the OA by only ~2 to 3%. Moreover, the results show that the OA of LDA outperforms the OA of C4.5 and naive Bayes tree by ~20%. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper discusses the method to automatic mass segmentation and analysis of mammogram for classification of benign or malignant tumor. The identification process is started with image enhancement through cropping to remove artifacts, then followed by increasing the contrast through Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The selection of mass candidate is carried out through 2 phases: marking the suspected mass area (Region of Interest - ROI) using adaptive thresholding p-tile technique and marking the connected components, and texture feature extracting on the ROI to classify whether the ROI is mass or non-mass. The texture feature extraction is performed by Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) set up on four different directions, 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. The application captures a mammogram image as an input and displays the presence of suspicious mass and its margin, if any. The segmented mass is analyzed based on its shape and margin. Thereafter, these information can be used by physicians to classify the type of tumor and to decide whether a biopsy is necessary. The application is evaluated using the mammogram data from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS). The MIAS data consist of 207 images of normal breast, 64 benign, and 51 malignant. 85 mammograms of MIAS data have mass. It is tested using Mammogram from Picture Archive Communication System (PACS) Pertamina hospital. Based on the study conducted, the algorithm developed step by step can localize the suspected area therefore it is able to detect the shape and the edge of mass on mammogram. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Government system has been developed in various countries. Currently, e-Government specifically appears in various paradigms, such as e-Procurement, e-Voting. Lastly, has emerged a new paradigm in e- Government, called e-Livestock. Therefore, in this study, we will propose and discuss about several success factors for e-Livestock in Indonesia. We will take into account four previous researches that are related to this research. Based on four previous researches, we compose first round questionnaire that consists of 65 suggested success factors. We also compose second round questionnaire that consists of 14 suggested success factors. We combine and analyzed the result of both questionnaires, so that we get 62 success factors for e-Livestock in Indonesia. We propose that in practice, to make their initiative success, all of the 62 success factors that resulted from this research have to exist and be accommodated by all parties that involved in the e-Livestock initiative in Indonesia. © 2013 Science Publications.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper investigates the application of the kernel PCA to select the features that produced by an extraction feature method, i.e. complete local binary pattern from three orthogonal planes. The proposed approach is used to detect Alzheimer's disease using 3D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of brain. In this study, the feature extraction method is done by using the different radius and the number of different neighbors. A support vector machine classifier is adapted to discriminant normal from Alzheimer's, normal from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and MCI from Alzheimer's. The experimental results show our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 100% for classification of Alzheimer's and normal. This accuracy result is also achieved by MCI and normal classification, whereas the accuracy of Alzheimer's and MCI classification is only 84%. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Beef cattle identification in a livestock management framework is an important issue. It is related to registration and traceability which are very important for breeding, production and distribution of the beef cattle. The muzzle pattern as a mean of identification has been studied since 1921 and several papers have proven that it can be used in the case of the cattle identification. The muzzle pattern has characteristic like the human's fingerprint. In this study, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) approach has been evaluated for the identification purpose based on biometrics and compared with methods from the previous two research papers. The numbers of matched-keypoints have been defined as the matching score. The matching refinement technique based on the keypoint's orientation information has been proposed to eliminate the miss-matched keypoints so that the identification performance is increased. Based on the experimental results which use data consisting of 160 muzzle pattern images from 20 individuals, the original SIFT approach has had the best performance compared to the previous methods with the value of the Equal Error Rate (EER) being equal to 0.0167. The proposed matching refinement technique has successfully reduced the false matching so that the value of the EER has been decreased to 0.0028. The SIFT approach and the proposed matching refinement technique can be a potential method for the beef cattle identification based on the image of the muzzle pattern lifted on paper. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we developed the system for recognizing the orchid species by using the images of flower. We used MSRM (Maximal Similarity based on Region Merging) method for segmenting the flower object from the background and extracting the shape feature such as the distance from the edge to the centroid point of the flower, aspect ratio, roundness, moment invariant, fractal dimension and also extract color feature. We used HSV color feature with ignoring the V value. To retrieve the image, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Orchid is a unique flower. It has a part of flower called lip (labellum) that distinguishes it from other flowers even from other types of orchids. Thus, in this paper, we proposed to do feature extraction not only on flower region but also on lip (labellum) region. The result shows that our proposed method can increase the accuracy value of content based flower image retrieval for orchid species up to ± 14%. The most dominant feature is Centroid Contour Distance, Moment Invariant and HSV Color. The system accuracy is 85,33% in validation phase and 79,33% in testing phase. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a simple and computationally efficient framework for 3D dance basic motion recognition based on syntactic pattern recognition. In this research, a class of basic dance motions is modeled by a stochastic regular grammar (SRG), inferred from training dataset, in which key body poses that are learned from training dataset are selected as gesture primitives. To represent a dance motion, body pose of a dancer is represented by angular coordinate of 15 skeleton joints. This feature is later compacted into one-dimensional string of labels for grammar inference which makes the recognition process is considerably fast compared to statistical pattern classifier such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN). A single test using the learned grammar in average takes only about 5 ms compared to around 20s using kNN whilst the overhead time to build all grammars takes only about 3.4s. This compacting process, however, leads to information loss which is observed in slightly degraded recognition performance for low articulated motions but quite large degradation for high articulated dance motions. To overcome this, we investigate several reliable feature selection methods such as Sequential Feature Selection (SFS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Heuristic Sequential Feature Selection (HSFS) compared to the use of whole features. Based on our experiment, the HSFS is the most suitable feature selection to overcome this problem. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The songket recognition is a challenging task. The SIFT and SURF, which are feature descriptors, are considered as potential features for pattern matching. The Songket is a special pattern originally from Indonesia; The Songket Palembang is used in this research. One motif in the Songket Palembang may has several different basic patterns. The matching scores, i.e., distance measure and number of keypoint, are evaluated corresponding with the SIFT and SURF method. SIFT method has been better than SURF method, but SURF has been extremely faster than SIFT. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes a geospatial knowledge discovery model of historical maps data set with relative geographic referenced. The knowledge about spatiotemporal dynamic is represented by the transition rules of cellular automata model. Set of transition rules obtained by applying three data mining techniques on large amount of data grid. First, multiple linear regression analysis applied on each subsequent pair of N data grid to obtained (N-1) rules. Second, by applying clustering analysis, then they extracted into a small number of rules, which is represented all of the rules, and they associated with the first data grid of the related pair. Finally, the selected rules used in determining the next value of the given data using classification analysis. Selection of the rule applied to the data based on the distance between the data and the associated data grid of the selected rule. The model had been evaluated on ordinal data type from fire danger rating and nominal data from land use and land cover status. Model accuration measured and visualized by comparing actual data and the simulated data. The accuration ranges between 80%-95% in the first case and 90,5%-95,2% in the second. In the first case, by the segmentation of the model, the performance can be improved significantly, especially for von Neumann scheme. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a development of a new approach for detecting slums area, when the density of area is very high. The basic idea of this method is based on regularity pattern of housing. We explore Gabor filter and GLCP based feature extraction to obtain the regularity feature. Then, we employ GINI index decision tree for detection. The images from Google Earth were then used in the experiment to assess our method. We select the slum areas which are defined by the local government, based on the datasheet from Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) - Indonesia Center Bureau of Statistics as the ground truth. Finally we found that our method can perform automatic detection for area that is a slum or potentially becomes a slum, based on the given satellite image. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The initiative to develop an e-Government system has been proliferated in several countries. However, a lot of e-Government initiatives are fail. Several success factors should be accommodated to avoid the failures. There have been some researchers who tried to formulate various kinds of success factors that related to e-Government initiative. However, all of those success factors are scattered in various studies in form of conference papers or journal articles. There were 46 studies were included in this study. All of them are considered to be related in reciprocal translation. There are 335 concepts of success factors that obtained from the included studies. Those concepts further be translated and synthesized. As the foremost result, 36 success factors for e-Government initiative are obtained. Those 36 success factor should be accommodated by all parties that involved in the e-Government initiative. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we analyze the performance of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal compression by comparing original and reconstructed signal on two problems. First, automatic sleep stage classification based on ECG signal; second, arrhythmia classification. An effective ECG signal compression method based on two-dimensional wavelet transform which employs set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) and beat reordering technique used to compress the ECG signal. This method utilizes the redundancy between adjacent samples and adjacent beats. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D (2 dimension) ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields relatively low distortion at high compression rate. The experimental results also show that the accuracy of sleep stage classification and arrhythmia classification using reconstructed ECG signal from proposed method is comparable to the original signal. The proposed method preserved signal characteristics for the automatic sleep stage and arrhythmia classification problems.</dc:abstract>

Cattle segmentation from its background is required in several typical applications, such as: the automatic cattle race classification. The cattle's fur detection which is inspired from the human skin detection is investigated in this paper for cattle and background segmentation in automatic beef cattle race classification. The Gaussian mixture model that was used in skin detection has been adopted to model Bali cow and Hybrid Ongole cow in this beef cattle race classification. The RGB color space and two texture descriptors are used as the features set. The addition of texture descriptor has increased the performance of the fur detection and automatic race classification. The GMM performs well but the noise and the complexity of the background lead to misclassification. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a linguistically motivated approach for dance gesture performance evaluation using skeleton tracking to robustly classify arbitrary dance gesture into one of predefined gesture classes and provide performance score in regards to the dance master's gesture. The gesture class in this study is a set common gesture of Bali traditional dances. The dance gesture is represented as a set of skeleton feature descriptors that are extracted from images captured using Kinect depth sensor. A set of rules are learned from the training examples to capture the structure of the gesture motion using grammar inference method. The empiric results showed that elbow and foot of dance performer are the most discriminative features for representing dance gesture of Bali traditional dance. Probabilistic and deterministic grammars achieved 0.92 and 0.95 of average precision for recognizing the tested dance gestures. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Bali traditional dance has gain international reputation thanks to its highly articulated body-part motions, fascinating eyes movement, facial expressions, and colorful costumes. Although the motions are viewed as the main aesthetic factors, automatic recognition and verification of their kinesthetic elements using computer is a challenging problem. Numerous studies have been conducted on dance recognition from its kinesthetic elements, however, to the best of our knowledge, little is known on automatic annotation, clustering, recognition, and verification of Bali traditional dance elements. This paper presents a skeleton descriptor based on dynamic time warping which enables similarity measurement between two dance sequences that may vary in time and speed. Our experiments shown that a combination of a set of time-series descriptors and exponential data time warping distance achieved the highest clustering performance than other tested combinations. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An effective electrocardiogram (ECG) signal compression method based on two-dimensional wavelet transform which employs set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) and beat reordering technique is presented. This method utilizes the redundancy between adjacent samples and adjacent beats. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. This rearrangement reduces variances between adjacent beats so that the 2D ECG array contains less high frequency component. The experiments on two datasets from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database revealed that the proposed method is more efficient for ECG signal compression in comparison with several previous proposed methods in literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields relatively low distortion at high compression rate. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>e-Government system can support the government in serving the public. Currently, e-Government specifically appears in various paradigms. The newest is e-Livestock that is closely related to e-Government in the field of livestock. Since it is relatively new, it will be hard to define what e-Livestock is. In this paper, the definition of e-Livestock for Indonesia, which has been formulated in previous work, will be adjusted based on input from several experts and stakeholders in the field of livestock in Indonesia. In addition, some expected benefits and challenges of e-Livestock in Indonesia will also be identified in this paper using several methods in the qualitative research, i.e. interview and hermeneutic. The adjusted definition along with the expected benefits and the challenges lists that have been identified in this research can be used as a material consideration when implementing e-Livestock in Indonesia. It is expected that all the challenges that have been identified subsequently be solved, and all the expected benefits are maximized, so that the implementation of e-Livestock in Indonesia will be successful. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Several previous researchers in sleep stages classification often considered that sleep stages were independent events. They have assumed that every epoch in sleep stages is independent. By nature, sleep is a sequence process so that the current sleep stages will affect to the next sleep stages. Ten datasets of single lead ECG signal from healthy people have been collected. Fifteen features can be extracted from raw ECG signal to describe the sleep stages. Smoothing signal using wavelet denoising is done as the preprocessing steps in order to eliminate noise. Data normalization of input value is also used to handle extreme feature values which will be mapped by activation function in neural network approach. This paper evaluate contribution of temporal pattern in the sleep stages classification result based on fact that sleep stages is a time series data. Multlayer perceptron (MLP) and Time Delay Neural network (TDNN) using standard back propagation algorithm and moment technique are applied to analyze the contribution of the temporal pattern. TDNN is an extended of MLP that the inputs are sequence of current epoch and previous epoch. TDNN as a classifier that can learn temporal pattern has shown better performance than MLP. It shows that temporal pattern takes a part to determine the correct classification result in the sleep stages classification. An appropriate memory long of temporal pattern is required to get the optimal classification result because longer memory cannot guarantee that the classification result is always better. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

There are some developed countries that have implemented such system "like" e-Livestock. The main objective of this research is to get the appropriate definition of e-Livestock in Indonesia. The definition is obtained by studying the experiences form other countries and by considering the current livestock conditions in Indonesia. This research uses the interpretivism and can be included into the qualitative research category. Some of the methods that are used in this research are collecting related documents and interpretation using hermeneutic. The resulted definition can be used as guidelines in further researches that are related to the development of e-Livestock in Indonesia. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The existence of imbalanced data between one class and another class is an important issue to be considered in a classification problem. One of the well-known data balancing technique is the artificial oversampling, which increase the size of datasets. In this research, multinomial classification was applied to classify some recorded features obtained from a single ECG (electrocardiograph) sensor. Therefore, a Dirichlet process, a dirichlet distribution of cumulative distribution function of each data partition, was needed to model the distribution of the new generated data by also considering the statistical properties of the previous data. Data balancing process had given the result of 77.21% classification accuracy (CA), and 90.9% area under ROC curve (AUC). © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we examine denoising performance of four wavelet thresholding algorithms i.e., Universal, Rigrous SURE, Minimax with hard and soft threshold, and Neighbourhood based threshold on synthetic and real ECG signal. We apply the Stationary Wavelet Transform to decompose ECG signal into wavelet domain. Performance analysis was performed by evaluating Mean Square Error (MSE) and visual inspection over the denoised signal from each algorithm. The experimental result shows that Universal hard thresholding gives the best denoising performance on synthetic ECG signal. This result is consistent with the experiment on real ECG signal. The result shows that soft threshold not always gives better denoising performance; it depends on which wavelet thresholding algorithm was choosen. The use of Neighbourhood based thresholding on synthetic and real ECG signal shows over smooth denoised signal. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The development of e-Government system has been widely carried out in some countries. However, some of them are failed. One of the failure factors is when the system can not meets the stakeholders need. Therefore, in this paper, it is proposed a methodology that based on one kind of soft systems thinking, i.e. the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). One other method is added to the SSM, i.e. Focus Group Discussions (FGD). With the combination of SSM with FGD, it is expected that the social interactions of stakeholders can be accommodated, so that the failure of e-government systems development can be reduced. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>GIS has many facilities that can be useful in various fields, including in e-Government system. This study assesses the implementation of GIS in the e-Government system provided by ninety-one institutions in Indonesia. The assessment was conducted using several criterias. These criterias include GIS availability and accessibility in the first place, GIS facility establishment date, and GIS technology and interactivity. The assessment was also done to check whether or not there is integration between GIS facilities among the institution that has implemented GIS facility. The results of this study show that seventeen of the total assessed official website has implemented GIS facilities. Seven of those websites are only showing a static map, while others are in the form of dynamic GIS facility. It is also identified that there is no integration among the institutions that have implemented GIS facility. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on sleep apnea detection using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The statistics of RR-intervals per epoch with 1 minute duration were used as an input. The combination of features proposed by Chazal and Yilmaz was transformed into orthogonal features using PCA. Cross validation, random sampling, and test on train data were used on model selection. The results of classification using kNN, Naïve- Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) show that PCA features give better classification accuracy compared to Chazal and Yilmaz features. SVM with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel gives the best classification accuracy by using 7 principal components (PC) as a features. The experimental results show that relation between Chazal features with target class tend to be linear, but Yilmaz and PCA features are non-linear. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Tooth pain is the most common form of orofacial pain. Tooth sensory system is very sensitive to detect noxious stimulus. Most of sensory stimulus, which come from pulp afferent fibres will cause pain sensation. Action potential transmits the stimulus from periphery to the central. Sodium channels have an important role to generate and propagate the action potential. One of its isoforms, Nav1.8, has only found in sensory nerve, especially in nociceptive neuron that deliver pain stimulus. In myelinated neuron such as A-δ fibres, sodium channels located in high density on the node of Ranvier. The density of sodium channel Nav1.8 has a strong relation with tooth sensitivity. We implement method to detect nodes of Ranvier and detect Nav1.8 as our region of interest. In this paper, threshold and local enhancement is used for nodes of Ranvier detection and improvement of Euclidean path for sodium channels Nav1.8 detection. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a study on area change detection applications based on remote sensing data. The crucial parts of the process are in selecting the optimal combination of bands and in the image clustering process, so that we could obtain the object regions correctly. The proposed methodology consists of the following steps: (i) image band selection using Optimum Index Factor; (ii) K-Means clustering where their cluster centres are determined by K-D tree; and (iii) detecting area changes. For experiment purposes, temporal images that are registered to each other are required. The image registration is done by matching several ground control points between two or more temporal images. The experiments have used the images of Kalimantan, with the size of 512512 pixels, and are recorded in the years of 2002 and 2009. The experiments have used both random approach and K-D tree based approach for determining the initial cluster centres in the clustering process. The experimental results show that the K-D-tree based approach gave better results than the random approach in terms of the similarity measure of the clusters' members. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents the use of genetic algorithm in old document image enhancement and restoration. The term of 'old document' is document coming from hundreds years ago. The purpose of the study is to preserve the information contained in old documents into a digital form, because the process to rescue the old images using physical approach is too slow. The main contribution of this study is in the development of its fitness function to select new population and the best new enhanced image. The experimental results also show the influence of using the median filter in the image preprocessing. The results show relatively effective image enhancement (92.9% data get more than 90% success rate), and in general the effect of using the median filter preprocessing is not good that makes blurring effect to the images (only 59.5% data get success rate above 90%). © 2010 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel change detection technique using land use patterns as a reference. Detection process is a combination of post classification and algebra techniques, i.e. each of bi-temporal images will be segmented and applying two kinds of algebraic operation on the images covers addition and substraction of two images. Subsequently, we will classifiy each of pixel into four classes namely class 1 and class 4 (related to uninteresting areas), class 2 (associated with no-change area), and class 3 (the growth of new areas in accordance with pattern which was identified from the second image). The pattern for class 3 is identified using classification model that is resulted from the previous research. The model will classify the area into corresponding patterns, namely corridor, block, cubicles, network, geometric, holes, or diffuse. The result of this technique is able to differentiate the change or no-change area. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper evaluates five potential feature selection methods in the application of remote sensing. The five methods include the sequential forward floating selection, the joint pair approach, band selection based on variance, the principal component transform, and the visual-based selection. Optical-sensor image and synthetic aperture radar image are used for experiments. Several recommendations are made based on this study. For optical-sensor images, the five feature selection methods: sequential forward floating selection, joint pair, band selection, principal component transform, and visual-based selection could have about the same classification accuracy using two to five selected features. The case study has shown that the sequential forward floating selection is the best feature selection method for both optical and synthetic aperture radar feature image selection, followed by the joint pair (for two-feature selection), visual-based selection, band selection, and principal component transform. For band L and band X synthetic aperture radar feature images, entropy, homogeneity, inverse difference moment, and maximum probability, East to West and West to East semivariogram, the local mean value, maximum, and minimum are the best features of the co-occurrence matrix model, semivariogram model, and local statistic model. For Landsat TM images band 7, 4, 5, 3, 1, and 2 are significant feature images. Applying the sequential forward floating selection to select two to five features from the potential features can obtain classification accuracy greater than 90%.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This report proposes an adaptive recognition system, which is based on Kohonen self-organization network (KSOM). As the goals in the research on artificial neural network are to improve the recognition capability of the network and at the same time minimize the time needed for learning the patterns, these goals could be achieved by combining two types of learning, i.e. supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We have developed a new kind of hybrid neural learning system, combining unsupervised KSOM and supervised back-propagation learning rules. This hybrid neural system will henceforth be referred to as hybrid adaptive SOM with winning probability function and supervised BP or KSOM(WPF)-BP. This hybrid neural system could estimate the cluster distribution of given data, and directed it into predefined number of cluster neurons through creation and deletion mechanism. Comparison with other developed hybrid neural system is done for determination of various odors from Martha Tilaar Cosmetics product in an artificial odor recognition system. The performance of our developed learning system in term of its recognition ability and its learning time is explored in this report. © 2001 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper has proposed two image compression and decompression schemes for multispectral images. Two issues were considered in the proposed methods. The first issue is the possibility of applying the compression process directly to a set of multispectral images, where the standard JPEG should be applied to each individual image. Considering this issue, a compression and decompression method is proposed based on a hybrid of lower bit suppresion and KarhunenLoeve transform and named as KLT Hybrid. The second issue is the possibility of obtaining a general codebook for a bulky of typical data such as a set of hyperspectral images. Considering this issue, another compression and decompression method is proposed based on vector quantization (VQ) where the general codebook is obtained by a proposed fair-share amount method. Four performance indicators were used to evaluate the results. The indicators include compression ratio, root mean square error, maximum absolute error, and signal to noise ratio. The experimental results have shown good performance indication of both methods.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of cancer, fortunately, if it is detected early, even this type of cancer may be treated successfully. In this paper, we present a neural network approach for the automated separation of melanoma from benign categories of cancer, which exhibit melanoma-like characteristics. To reduce the computational complexities, while increasing the possibility of not being trapped in local minima of the back-propagation neural network, we applied Karhunen-Loeve transformation technique to the originally training patterns. We also utilized a cross entropy error function between the output and the target patterns. Using this approach, for reasonably balance of training/testing set, about 94% of correct classification of malignant and benign cancers could be obtained.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Multistage remote sensing data analysis produces land attribute maps which are stored as layers in a geographic information system. In regional planning, the identification of potential regions could not be assessed by only using the land attribute maps. It is also important to include another constraints such as the natural resource accessibility, environment quality, labor population and mobility, economic growth, market accessibility, and the participation of government, private agencies and local people. This paper presents the use of expert systems in the assessment of the quality of environment, social and economic conditions. The types of constraint are further used with the land attributes to evaluate the types of region development.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents the first results obtained in a study on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing in the framework of using the SAR data for conservation site and monitoring. A comparative study of median filtering, adaptive Lee filtering, and lineament enhancement was done with emphasis on the applicability to speckle elimination and texture edges preserving. The result shows that the adaptive Lee filtering preserves the texture edges best followed by the median filtering. A comparative study of the texture features based on a concept of texture units, the texture features based on the co-occurrence matrix, and the texture features based on the use of local statistics was also done with emphasis on the applicability to object differentiation. Random sampling, clustering, and minimum distance classification techniques were used for the image segmentation. At this stage of experiment, it could be recommended that the geometric symmetry and the degree of direction features of texture units, the contrast and the inverse difference moment features of the co-occurrence matrix, the local mean and the local ratio between the standard deviation and the mean value are potential features for SAR image classification. A combination of filtered image tone and texture features in some cases may improve the classification accuracy. © 1994, Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Reasoning is an important aspect for an intelligent agent to come to a rational decision. With the same importance is the ability of such an agent to adapt itself to the environment by learning new knowledge from its observations. When the agent's knowledge base is represented by a logic program, goal-directed deliberative reasoning and the adaptive ability of such an agent can be achieved by abduction and updating on logic programs, respectively. Furthermore, the tabling feature in logic programming, which affords solutions reuse rather than recomputing them, enables an agent to make an immediate decision based on past reasoning, thus avoiding repetitive deliberative reasoning. Joint tabling of logic program abduction and updating is an approach first proposed by Pereira and Saptawijaya, motivated by its application in machine ethics, enabling an agent to make moral decisions, using their system Qualm. In this paper, we provide a complete program transformation which has not been detailed on that approach. We also resolve previously unidentified issues with respect to its implementation aspects. A prototype, Qualm∗, is implemented as a proof of concept using XSB Prolog. Furthermore, an application is detailed, using Qualm', emphasizing the importance of joint tabling of logic program abduction and updating, in the context of intelligent agents, specifically in ambient intelligence for eldercare. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The course timetabling problem can be defined as the task of assigning a number of lectures into a limited set of time slots and rooms, subject to a set of given constraints. The potential of Answer Set Programming (ASP), an extension of logic programming, t declaratively model course timetabling problems has been exhibited in the international course timetabling competition. Within ASP, a problem is expressed as a logic program and the solutions to the problem are obtained from the semantics of the logic program, viz., the stable models of the program. In this paper, ASP is employed to encode the course timetabling problem of the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia, aiming at satisfying hard constraints and minimizing the penalty incurred due to the violation of soft constraints. We identify hard constraints from this real world problem that have not been considered in the existing ASP approach, and we show how they are expressed in ASP. Our experiments using the state-of-The-Art ASP solver clingo show that several alternatives of optimal course timetables are successfully delivered while satisfying all hard constraints in an encouraging execution time. We also provide a lightweight application with a graphical user interface and clingo as the back-end, that automatically pre-processes an instance specification into clingo syntax, computes and post-processes its solutions into a tabular form. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Abduction is a form of logical inference that seeks out best explanations for a given observation. Abduction has already been well studied in the field of computational logic, and logic programming in particular. In contextual abduction, explanations obtained within one context may also be relevant in different contexts. In such contextual abduction, explanations thus can be reused with little cost. When abduction is realized in logic programming, one can reuse previously obtained explanations from one context to another by benefiting from a logic programming's feature called tabling. In this paper, we revisit tabling in contextual abduction and improve this technique with an advanced tabling feature of XSB Prolog, viz., answer subsumption. The employment of answer subsumption in this technique is important, when one is interested in obtaining minimal explanations for an observation. It also helps avoid tabling too many and large explanations for a given observation, which may fail contextual abduction in practice, as it requires too many resources before being able to return a solution. We provide a protoytpe, tabdual+, of this improved technique as a proof of concept. Our experiments, both in artificial and real world cases, show that Tabdual+ correctly returns minimal explanations, while the cost of their computation is greatly reduced. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to increase ETL process efficiency flud reduce processing time by applying the method of Change Data Capture (CDC) in distributed system using Hadoop Distributed file System (HDFS) and Apache Spark in the data warehouse of Learning Analytics system of Universitas Indonesia. Usually, increases in I lie number of records in the data source result in an increase in ETL processing time for the data warehouse system. This condition occurs as a result of inefficient ETL process using the full load method. Using the tull load method, ETL has to process the same number of records as the number of records in the data sources. The proposed ETL model design with the application of CDC method using HDFS and Apache Spark can reduce the amount of data in the ETL process. Consequently, the process becomes more efficient and the ETL processing time Is reduced approximately 53% in average. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a computational model, via Logic Programming (LP), of counterfactual reasoning with applications to agent morality. Counterfactuals are conjectures about what would have happened, had an alternative event occurred. In the first part, we show how counterfactual reasoning, inspired by Pearl's structural causal model of counterfactuals, is modeled using LP, by benefiting from LP abduction and updating. In the second part, counterfactuals are applied to agent morality, resorting to this LP-based approach. We demonstrate its potential for specifying and querying moral issues, by examining viewpoints on moral permissibility via classic moral principles and examples taken from the literature. Finally, we discuss some potential extensions of our LP approach to cover other aspects of counterfactual reasoning and show how these aspects are relevant in modeling agent morality.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study investigates how the number of data collected for algorithm development in typical case-1 waters and optically complex cases can affect the remote sensing of ocean color (OC) products. Marine conditions dominated by the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and nonalgal particles are considered. The applied OC inversion schemes are based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural nets for data classification and regression. Simulated data for MLP training are generated with a forward OC model. Results show that a disproportion of samples representing different marine optical cases influences the MLP learning and hence also the data product retrieval, mostly in mixed case-1 and CDOM-dominated environments. A postclassification correction is then employed for performance improvements. Methodological developments are presented, acknowledging the coastal water monitoring prioritized by the Copernicus Earth Observation program. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This article investigates the appropriateness of LP-based reasoning to machine ethics, an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that emerges from the need of imbuing autonomous agents with the capacity for moral decision making. The first contribution of the article is that of identifying morality viewpoints, as studied in moral philosophy and psychology, which are amenable to computational modelling, and then mapping them to appropriate LP-based reasoning features. The identified viewpoints are covered by two morality themes: moral permissibility and the dual-process model. In the second contribution, various LP-based reasoning features are applied to model these identified morality viewpoints, via classic moral examples taken offthe-shelf from the literature. For this purpose, our Qualm system, which features a combination of LP abduction, updating and counterfactuals, supported by LP tabling mechanisms, are mainly employed. The applications are also supported by other existing LP-based systems, featuring preference handling and probabilistic reasoning, which complement Qualm in addressing the morality viewpoints in question. © The Author 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this chapter, a survey of research in machine ethics is presented, providing the context and the motivation for our investigations. The survey concerns the individual realm of machine ethics, whereas the background to other realm, the collective one, is broached in Chap. 9, namely Sects. 9.1 and 9.2.1. The first realm views computation as a vehicle for representing moral cognition of an agent and its reasoning thereof, which motivates our investigation for employing Logic Programming (LP) knowledge representation and reasoning features with respect to the individual realm of machine ethics. On the other hand, the second realm emphasizes the emergence, in a population, of evolutionarily stable moral norms, of fair and just cooperation, that ably discards free riders and deceivers, to the advantage of the whole evolved population. It provides a motivation of our research for introducing cognitive abilities, such as intention recognition, commitment, revenge, apology, and forgiveness, to reinforce the emergence of cooperation in the collective realm of machine ethics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In Chap. 4 we show the appropriateness of LP-based reasoning features for representing diverse issues of moral facets identified in Chap. 3. In this chapter, we discuss how these LP-based reasoning features are synthesized in three different systems: Acorda (Sect. 7.1), Probabilistic EPA (Sect. 7.2), and Qualm (Sect. 7.3). Whereas the development of Qualm is a contribution of this book, Acorda [11, 12, 15] and Probabilistic EPA [9, 10, 14] are two existing systems that have been developed earlier, but not with any specific wide principled implementation of morality in mind, as we shall see. Though these systems share its main feature, viz., abduction, each system concern itself with a particular combination of features. Moreover, their shared feature, abduction, implements different techniques, indicating the progress made in the development of these three systems. The three systems are employed to model, here, for the first time, different issues of considered moral facets, depending on the need of their respective combination of features. Their applications are elaborated in the subsequent Chap. 8. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This book discusses the two realms of machine ethics, a field that is now becoming a pressing concern and receiving wide attention due to its growing importance. It makes a number of original inroads that exhibit a proof of possibility to systematically represent and reason about a variety of issues from the chosen moral facets by means of moral examples taken off-the-shelf from the morality literature. Given the broad dimension of the topic, the contributions in the book touch solely on a dearth of morality issues. Nevertheless, it prepares and opens the way for additional research towards employing various features available in LP-based reasoning and EGT to machine ethics. Moreover, we draw attention to some salient philosophical considerations underpinning and surging from our work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Counterfactuals capture the process of reasoning about a past event that did not occur, namely what would have happened had this event occurred; or, vice-versa, to reason about an event that did occur but what if it had not. In this chapter, we innovatively make use of LP abduction and updating in an implemented procedure for evaluating counterfactuals, taking the established structural approach of Pearl as reference. Our approach concentrates on pure non-probabilistic counterfactual reasoning in LP, resorting to abduction and updating, in order to determine the logical validity of counterfactuals under the Well-Founded Semantics. Nevertheless, the approach is adaptable to other semantics, too. Even though the LP technique introduced in this chapter is relevant for modeling counterfactual moral reasoning, its use is general, not specific to morality. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We have been addressing problems in machine ethics dealt with by using computational techniques. In the preceding chapters, our research has focused on Computational Logic, particularly Logic Programming, and its appropriateness to model morality, namely moral permissibility, its justification, and the dual-process ofmoral judgments regarding the realm of the individual. Now, in the sections of this chapter, we address the collective realm computationally, using Evolutionary Game Theory in populations of individuals, to report on norms and morality emergence. These populations, to start with, are not equipped with much cognitive capability, and simply act from a predetermined set of actions. Our research has shown that the introduction of cognitive capabilities, such as intention recognition, commitment, apology, forgiveness, and revenge, separately and jointly, reinforce the emergence of cooperation in populations, comparatively to their absence. We then prospect future work concerned with adding guilt. In particular, we show: • how learning to recognize intentions and committing resolve cooperation dilemmas; • the evaluation of two strategies in the emergence of cooperation in groups, viz., avoidance versus restriction; • the role of apology in committed versus commitment-free repeated interactions; • how apology and forgiveness evolve to resolve failures in cooperative agreements; • the role that guilt may play to prime apology and forgiveness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The main content of this chapter addresses the relevance of the ground breaking work of Alan Turing to justify our functionalism stance regarding the modeling of morality. Building intelligent machines seeks a partial understanding of the emergence of higher-level properties, like morality. Functionalism holds that the material substrate is not of the essence, and that it suffices to realize equivalent functionality albeit by way of a different material vehicle. The most fruitful inquires into the nature of “mind” or “general intelligence” shall include the use of Artificial Intelligence to simulate complex mental operations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In prior chapterswe have addressed issues and topics of machine ethics programming, whether from the individual or from the collective viewpoints, which we dub “the two realms.” Bridging capabilities between the two realms, towit, the individual and collective, helps understand the emergent ethical behavior of agents in groups, and implements them not just in simulations, but in the world of future robots and their swarms. With our co-authors, have staked footholds on either side of the two realms gap, and promoted their mutually beneficial bridging. In studies of human morality, these distinct interconnected realms are evinced too: one stressing above all individual cognition, deliberation, and behavior; the other stressing collective morals, and how they emerged. Of course, the two realms are necessarily intertwined, for cognizant individuals form populations, and the twain evolved jointly to cohere into collective norms, and into individual interaction. Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Anthropology and the Cognitive Sciences provide inspirational teachings to that effect. The chapter is naturally organized as follows. First, on the basis of preceding chapters, we consider the bridging of these two realms in machine ethics. Last but not least, we ponder over the teachings of human moral evolution in this regard. A final coda foretells a road to be tread, and portends about ethical machines and us. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the individual realm part of this book, we are addressing the interplay amongst appropriate LP features to represent moral facets and to reason about them. One such interplay is between LP abduction and updating, both supported with tabling mechanisms. In this chapter, we propose novel approaches for employing tabling in abduction and updating—separately—viz., tabling abductive solutions in contextual abduction (Sect. 5.1), plus the incremental tabling of fluents for LP updating (Sect. 5.2). Moreover, these two individual approaches form the components for their subsequent joint tabling technique when combining LP abduction and updating, to be discussed in detail in Chap. 7. The new techniques introduced here, as well as their later joint combination, are general for normal logic programs, and not specific to morality applications. That is, they are of interest in themselves and may be applicable to other domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This chapter aims at realizing our conception about representing diverse moral facets in Logic Programming, by modeling several issues pertaining to those moral facets, using the three systems discussed in Chap. 7. The applicability of these systems corresponds with their relevance to the moral issues being modeled. In Sect. 8.1, Acorda is employed to model moral permissibility, emphasizing the use of integrity constraints in abduction and preferences over abductive scenarios, where several cases of the classic trolley problem aremodeled. Then, moral reasoning concerning uncertain actions is modeled, in Sect. 8.2, by means of Probabilistic EPA. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Qualm for modeling the issue of moral updating and counterfactual moral reasoning, in Sect. 8.3. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Counterfactuals are conjectures about what would have happened, had an alternative event occurred. It provides lessons for the future by virtue of contemplating alternatives; it permits thought debugging; it supports a justification why different alternatives would have been worse or not better. Typical expressions are: “If only I were taller …”, “I could have been a winner …”, “I would have passed, were it not for …”, “Even if … the same would follow”. Counterfactuals have been well studied in Linguistics, Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Psychology, Anthropology, and Computation, but not much within Critical Thinking. The purpose of this study is to illustrate counterfactual thinking, through logic program abduction and updating, and inspired by Pearl’s structural theory of counterfactuals, with an original application to morality, a common concern for critical thinking. In summary, we show counterfactual reasoning to be quite useful for critical thinking, namely about moral issues. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Abduction as reasoning paradigm has been much explored in Artificial Intelligence, but not yet taken up by decision making as much as its potential warrants. Indeed, abduction permits the generation of hypothetical knowledge based scenarios, about which one can then equate decisions. One reason for this state of affairs is that abduction is difficult to implement efficaciously, even by experts, which entails that abductive systems are not readily available for decision making. Our concept of tabled abduction mitigates this, in the abductive logic programming system TABDUAL. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) We discuss some TABDUAL improvements towards its more practical use, particularly in decision making, (2) We show that declarative debugging can be viewed as abduction in logic programming, thus showing another potential of abduction for decision making, and (3) We describe how TABDUAL can be applied in decision making and examine its benefit. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We propose a novel conceptual approach to program updates implementation that exploits two features of tabling in logic programming (in XSB Prolog): incremental and answer subsumption tabling. Our approach, EVOLP/R, is based on the constructs of Evolving Logic Programs (EVOLP), but simplifies it at first by restricting updates to fluents only. Rule updates are nevertheless achieved via the mechanism of rule name fluents, placed in rules' bodies, permitting to turn rules on or off, through assertions or retractions of their corresponding unique name fluents. Incremental tabling of fluents allows to automatically maintain - at engine level - the consistency of program states. Answer subsumption of fluents addresses the frame problem - at engine level - by automatically keeping track of their latest assertion or retraction. The implementation is detailed here to the extent that it may be exported to other logic programming tabling systems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Despite its potential as a reasoning paradigm in AI applications, abduction has been on the back burner in logic programming, as abduction can be too difficult to implement, and costly to perform, in particular if abductive solutions are not tabled. If they become tabled, then abductive solutions can be reused, even from one abductive context to another. On the other hand, current Prolog systems, with their tabling mechanisms, are mature enough to facilitate the introduction of tabling abductive solutions (tabled abduction) into them. The concept of tabled abduction has been realized recently in an abductive logic programming system tabdual. Besides tabling abductive solutions, tabdual also relies on the dual transformation. In this paper, we emphasize two tabdual improvements: (1) the dual transformation by need, and (2) a new construct for accessing ongoing abductive solutions, that permits modular mixes between abductive and non-abductive program parts. We apply subsequently these improvements on two distinct problems, and evaluate the performance and the scalability of tabdual on several benchmarks on the basis of these problems, by examining four tabdual variants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We foster a novel implementation technique for logic program updates, which exploits incremental tabling in logic programming - using XSB Prolog to that effect. Propagation of updates of fluents is controlled by initially keeping any fluent updates pending in the database. And, on the initiative of queries, making active just those updates up to the timestamp of an actual query, by performing incremental assertions of the pending ones. These assertions, in turn, automatically trigger system-implemented incremental bottom-up tabling of other fluents (or their negated complements), with respect to a predefined overall upper time limit, in order to avoid runaway iteration. The frame problem can then be dealt with by inspecting a table for the latest time a fluent is known to be assuredly true, i.e., the latest time it is not supervened by its negated complement, relative to the given query time. To do so, we adopt the dual program transformation for defining and helping propagate, also incrementally and bottom-up, the negated complement of a fluent, in order to establish whether a fluent is still true at some time point, or rather if its complement is. The use of incremental tabling in this approach affords us a form of controlled, but automatic, system level truth-maintenance, up to some actual query time. Consequently, propagation of update side-effects need not employ top-down recursion or bottom-up iteration through a logically defined frame axiom, but can be dealt with by the mechanics of the underlying world. Our approach thus reconciles high-level top-down deliberative reasoning about a query, with autonomous low-level bottom-up world reactivity to ongoing updates, and it might be adopted elsewhere for reasoning in logic. © Springer-Verlag 2013.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The retrieval of Ocean Color (OC) data products is here investigated by using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural nets. Synthetic data have been generated for this scope with a forward OC model. These samples have then been used to train and assess the MLP performance considering different seawater types (WTs) with optical properties driven by: chlorophyll (Chl-a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and non-pigmented particulate matter (NPPM), as well as a mixture of Chl-a, CDOM and NPPM (denoted MIXI). Acknowledging that MLP classification results represent WT posterior probabilities, an integrated machine learning approach is set up by joining MLPs for data regression and classification in a composite scheme. Results indicate that this approach is valuable to support the use of regional ocean color inversion schemes by decomposing the overall challenge in sub-components, optimally addressing each of them, and combining the individual solutions in a principled framework.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a Logic Programming framework for moral reasoning under uncertainty. It is enacted by a coherent combination of our two previously implemented systems, Evolution Prospection for decision making, and P-log for probabilistic inference. It allows computing available moral judgments via distinct kinds of prior and post preferences. In introducing various aspects of uncertainty into cases of classical trolley problem moral dilemmas, we show how they may appropriately influence moral judgments, allowing decision makers to opt for different choices, and for these to be externally appraised, even when subject to incomplete evidence, as in courts. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Morality no longer belongs only to the realm of philosophers. Recently, there has been a growing interest in understanding morality from the scientific point of view. This interest comes from various fields, for example, primatology (de Waal 2006), cognitive sciences (Hauser 2007; Mikhail 2007), neuroscience (Tancredi 2005), and other various interdisciplinary perspectives (Joyce 2006; Katz 2002). The study of morality also attracts the artificial intelligence community from the computational perspective and has been known by several names, including machine ethics, machine morality, artificial morality, and computational morality. Research on modeling moral reasoning computationally has been conducted and reported on, for example, at the AAAI 2005 Fall Symposium on Machine Ethics (Guarini 2005; Rzepka and Araki 2005). There are at least two reasons to mention the importance of studying morality from the computational point of view. First, with the current growing interest to understand morality as a science, modeling moral reasoning computationally will assist in better understanding morality. Cognitive scientists, for instance, can greatly benefit in understanding complex interaction of cognitive aspects that build human morality; they may even be able to extract moral principles people normally apply when facing moral dilemmas. Modeling moral reasoning computationally can also be useful for intelligent tutoring systems, for instance, to aid in teaching morality to children. Second, as artificial agents are more and more expected to be fully autonomous and work on our behalf, equipping agents with the capability to compute moral decisions is an indispensable requirement. © Cambridge University Press 2011.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The paper discusses cache utilization in state-of-the-art SAT solvers. The aim of the study is to show how a resource-unaware SAT solver can be improved by utilizing the cache sensibly. The analysis is performed on a CDCL-based SAT solver using a subset of the industrial SAT Competition 2009 benchmark. For the analysis, the total cycles, the resource stall cycles, the L2 cache hits and the L2 cache misses are traced using sample based profiling. Based on the analysis, several techniques - some of which have not been used in SAT solvers so far - are proposed resulting in a combined speedup up to 83% without affecting the search path of the solver. The average speedup on the benchmark is 60%. The new techniques are also applied to MiniSAT2.0 improving its runtime by 20% on average. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Several formal approaches have been proposed to analyse security protocols, e.g. [2,7,11,1,6,12]. Recently, a great interest has been growing on the use of constraint solving approach. Initially proposed by Millen and Shmatikov [9], this approach allows analysis of a finite number of protocol sessions. Yet, the representation of protocol runs by symbolic traces (as opposed to concrete traces) captures the possibility of having unbounded message space, allowing analysis over an infinite state space. A constraint is defined as a pair consisting of a message M and a set of messages K that represents the intruder's knowledge. Millen and Shmatikov present a procedure to solve a set of constraints, i.e. that in each constraint, M can be built from K. When a set of constraints is solved, then a concrete trace representing an attack over the protocol can be extracted. Corin and Etalle [4] has improved the work of Millen and Shmatikov by presenting a more efficient procedure. However, none of these constraint-based systems provide enough flexibility and expresiveness in specifying security properties. For example, to check secrecy an artificial protocol role is added to simulate whether a secret can be learned by an intruder. Authentication cannot also be checked directly. Moreover, only a built-in notion of authentication is implemented by Millen and Shmatikov in his Prolog implementation [10]. This problem motivates our current work. A logical formalism is considered to be an appropriate solution to improve the flexibility and expresiveness in specifying security properties. A preliminary attempt to use logic for specifying local security properties in a constraint-based setting has been carried out [3]. Inspired by this work and the successful NPATRL [11,8], we currently explores a variant of linear temporal logic (LTL) over finite traces, PS-LTL, standing for pure-past security LTL [5]. In contrast to standard LTL, this logic deals only with past events in a trace. In our current work, a protocol is modelled as in previous works [9,4,3], viz. by protocol roles. A protocol role is a sequence of send and receive events, together with status events to indicate, e.g. that a protocol role has completed her protocol run. A scenario is then used to deal with the number of sessions and protocol roles considered in the analysis. Integrating PS-LTL into our constraint solving approach presents a challenge, since we need to develop a sound and complete decision procedure against symbolic traces, instead of concrete traces. Our idea to address this problem is by concretizing symbolic traces incrementally while deciding a formula. Basically, the decision procedure consists of two steps: transform and decide. The former step transforms a PS-LTL formula with respect to the current trace into a so-called elementary formula that is built from constraints and equalities using logical connectives and quantifiers. The decision is then performed by the latter step through solving the constraints and checking the equalities. Although we define a decision procedure for a fragment of PS-LTL, this fragment is expressive enough to specify several security properties, like various notions of secrecy and authentication, and also data freshness. We provide a Prolog implementation and have analysed several security protocols. There are many directions for improvement. From the implementation point of view, the efficiency of the decision procedure can still be improved. I would also like to investigate the expressiveness of the logic for speficying other security properties. This may result in an extension of the decision procedure for a larger fragment of the logic. Another direction is to characterize the expressivity power of PS-LTL compared to other security requirement languages. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by the complications of diabetes mellitus and can cause blindness. In this study, we classified the stages of diabetic retinopathy using a large-scale dataset that consists of 35,126 fundus images. The classification of diabetic retinopathy includes five stages, from normal to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In the proposed approach, a morphological feature extraction method and advanced local binary patterns were employed to extract blood vessel and texture features, respectively. The support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and logistic regression techniques were compared as classifiers. The classification was conducted on fundus images from a Kaggle dataset. The experimental results show that the texture feature extraction method based on advanced local binary patterns leads to higher accuracy, precision, and recall score than the blood vessel features extracted using morphological operators. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We propose a Chernoff-bound approach and examine standard deviation value to enhance the accuracy of the existing fast incremental model tree with the drift detection (FIMT-DD) algorithm. It is a data stream mining algorithm that can observe and form a model tree from a large dataset. The standard FIMT-DD algorithm uses the Hoeffding bound for its splitting criterion. The use of the simplified Chernoff bound is proposed for splitting a tree more accurately than the Hoeffding bound. We verify our proposed Chernoff bound and standard deviation value examination by evaluating several large real-world datasets that consists of 100,000,000 instances. The result shows that our proposed method has an improvement in term of accuracy compared to the Hoeffding bound in the FIMT-DD algorithm. Error value measurements demonstrate that the Chernoff bound approach contributes to smaller error value compared to the standard method. In term of overall simulation time, the Chernoff bound approach increases the duration of simulation time and utilizes more memory compared to Hoeffding bound. However, Chernoff bound is much faster to get a smaller error compared to the standard algorithm. © 2019, The Author(s).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A 3D surface modeling format that is commonly used today is point cloud. 3D surface model segmentation could provide data for analysis in various fields. In the context of Geographic Information Systems, point cloud data obtained from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor are used by machines to automatically identify objects such as houses, buildings, land, and rivers. There has been many Deep Learning approach through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been proven to be very capable for 2-dimensional imagery classification and segmentation. PointNet is a Deep Learning architecture that is designed so that the point cloud format that is still tabular form, can be directly convoluted by the CNN model. In this study, an improvement of PointNet is proposed for Point Cloud data of Kupang City. The Point Cloud data were acquired using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with a LiDAR sensor installed. The data were pre-processed and divided into training and testing data. The data were processed with the PointNet architecture and the model was tested using several metrics. The experiment shows that the PointNet architecture is capable on segmenting Geographical Point Cloud Data. In addition, incorporating voxel's color features could increase the performance of the segmentation. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Today, big data processing has become a challenging task due to the amount of data collected using various sensors increasingly significantly. To build knowledge and predict the data, traditional data mining methods calculate all numerical attributes into the memory simultaneously. The data stream method is a solution for processing and calculating data. The method streams incrementally in batch form; therefore, infrastructure memory is sufficient to develop knowledge. The existing method for data stream prediction is FIMT-DD (Fast Incremental Model Tree-Drift Detection). Using this method, knowledge is developed in tree form for every instance. In this paper, enhanced FIMT-DD is proposed using ARDEV (Average Restrain Divider of Evaluation Value). ARDEV utilizes the Chernoff bound approach with error evaluation, improvement in learning rate, modification of perceptron rule calculation, and utilization of activation function. Standard FIMT-DD separates the tree formation process and perceptron prediction. The proposed method evaluates and connects the development of the tree for knowledge formation and the perceptron rule for prediction. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is measured using MAE, RMSE and MAPE. From the experiment performed, the utilization of ARDEV enhancement shows significant improvement in terms of accuracy prediction. Statistically, the overall accuracy prediction improvement is approximately 6.99 % compared to standard FIMT-DD with a traffic dataset. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Vehicle growth in Indonesia is not supported by the number of the road. This fact has caused traffic congestion easily occurred, especially in big cities. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is one of the solutions for this problem. In ITS, vehicle tracking and counting is a challenging issue for traffic surveillance. In this paper, Bhattacharyya distance-based tracking and vehicle counting is proposed. We propose a vehicle tracking method and vehicle counting system. We use Adaptive Background Learning with Hole Filling Algorithm to separate background and foreground in a frame. We detect objects in foreground region using contour of each object. Each detected object tracked using Bhattacharyya distance. Each tracked object is counted when the tracked object passed a predefined counting line. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing tracking estimates with ground truth. We use precision and recall as metric to evaluate our tracking estimates with ground truth. Our vehicle counting result also evaluated by comparing to ground truth. Our tracking result have 96% recall in all experiment scenarios. Also, we have 1.3% and 7.4% error rate in our counting result compared to ground truth. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Predictions on time-series multivariate data, such as in the traffic flow dataset, have been largely accomplished through various approaches. The approach with conventional prediction algorithms, such as with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is only capable of accommodating predictions that are independent in each time unit. Hence, the sequential relationships in this time series data is hardly explored. Continuous Conditional Random Field (CCRF) is one of Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) algorithms which can accommodate this problem. The neighboring aspects of sequential data such as in the time series data can be expressed by CCRF so that its predictions are more reliable. In this article, CCRF is implemented to increase the prediction ability of different baseline regressors, i.e. SVM and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Both algorithms are examined in two different datasets. The result shows that CCRF is superior in performance when examined using dataset with more attribute. This is validated by the increasing of the coefficient of correlation of the baseline up to 7.3% of significance. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the eye diseases which is caused by Diabetes Mellitus, its effect can make blindness. DR can be detected from retinal image with various approaches such as area, color, statistic, and texture. In this study, we propose detection of DR by using texture feature characteristic from STARE database. A complete modelling of Local Binary pattern (CLBP) presented as feature extraction method of texture. Utilization of sign, magnitude and mean value are applied to this feature extraction approach. We have used Expectation Maximization-Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA) as feature selection method and KNN as a classifier. The experimental results (combination of CLBP sign and mean value, and combination of CLBP sign and magnitude) show better accuracy compare to another method. CLBP-SC (CLBP sign and mean value) has similar accuracy with CLBP-SM (CLBP sign and magnitude), where it is 97.16%. For sensitivity and specificity performance, the higher value is 98% and is 97% respectively. In addition, we also do running time comparison of five approaches. CLBP-SM gives good performance with smaller running time. These results suggest that our proposed method in this paper can be used in aid system diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

In traffic area included road traffic, railway traffic, and airline traffic, there is huge information can be obtained. The needed of big data analytics to process the data quickly and give an accurate prediction about it, became essential. The FIMT-DD with hyperbolic tangent (tanh) algorithm is proposed to predict the airline big data. The simulation time of FIMT-DD-tanh is almost the same with original FIMT-DD.

	<dc:abstract>The number of vehicles that exists on public roads have increased drastically over the years. This have caused several problems, where one of the most common problem is traffic jam. There have been several studies that have tried to solve this problem, such as by using real time videos with computer vision, wireless sensor networks, and traffic data predictions. In this study, we proposed a modification of Fast Incremental Model Trees with Drift Detections (FIMT-DD) to predict the traffic flow from a large traffic data set provided by the Government of United Kingdom. From our experiment results using large datasets, our proposed method have proven to be more accurate in predicting the traffic flow as compared to the conventional FIMT-DD Algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a system that have a capability to conduct data acquisition and monitoring in a wide sampling area for a long time. However, because of its big-scale monitoring, amount of data accumulated from WSN is very huge. Conventional database system may not be able to handle its big amount of data. To overcome that, big data approach is used for an alternative data storage system and data analysis process. This research developed a WSN system for CO2 monitoring using Kafka and Impala to distribute a huge amount of data. Sensor nodes gather data and accumulated in temporary storage then streamed via Kafka platform to be stored into Impala database.

	<dc:abstract>Carbon Dioxide gas (CO2) gas contained in our air which has many roles in environment, but in a huge amount it became dangerous. To encounter that, the system for CO2 monitoring is needed. One of the most effective way is using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This system capable to monitor concentration of CO2 and another variable using sensor nodes. But not all of that parameters is correlated to concentration of CO2. To make monitoring system runs efficiently, correlation analysis between variables is needed. This research conduct a correlation analysis between concentration of CO2 and humidity, temperature and light intensity from data collected by our own-made digital sensor node. Data gathered for seven days in one location with a fluctuate environment condition. Correlation calculated with Spearman's rho method. The result is CO2 and air humidity have a strong positive correlation with air humidity (0.726), weak negative correlation with light intensity (-0.319), and no correlation with air temperature (-0.008). © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a system used to conduct a remote monitoring in a wide monitoring area. It has a sensor node - a sampling point - which communicate each other to passing their data to central node for recapitulation or transmit it to data center. Because of that, communication system is a crucial thing for WSN. However, WSN may be deployed in a environment that far from ideal condition. Placed in an unattended area with far distance between nodes, WSN is very vulnerable with security threats. To overcome that, the good combination between communication protocol and encryption algorithm for WSN is needed to gather an accurate and representative data with high transmission speed. This research focused on finding those combination for our own-made low-cost sensor node for CO2 monitoring. In this research, two routing protocols (AODV and TARP) and several encryption algorithms (AES, ChaCha, and Speck) tested to determine which combination is give the best result. As the result, combination between routing protocol AODV and encryption algorithm Speck give the best result in the term of performance. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposed a method to build knowledge from one and a half years of UK traffic data sets. The method used is the Fast Incremental Model Trees - Drift Detection (FIMT-DD) with an improvement on the perceptron rule. In order to predict a traditional data set, we first analyze the model. After we have analyzed the model, we then average it from different arrangements of the datasets. In a stream data set, the approach is different from the traditional data sets. The approach of a stream data set is to take several snapshots during the induction to analyze the accuracy progress of the predicted model. We used the tanh activation function to optimize the perceptron rule. Therefore, we are able to reduce the error of the result. The error measurements that we analyzed in this paper are MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE. From 100,000,000 instances of traffic data, the optimized FIMT-DD algorithm method proves to be successful with smaller error value than standard FIMT-DD algorithm. To be able to measure the performance of the error of our optimized FIMT-DD algorithm, we used evaluate prediction sequential to analyze the data. According to the error measurement results of the MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE, tanh(x) activation function has a good influence to decrease the error value and improve the accuracy. The smaller error values did not only happen in a few experiments instances, but it occurs in the majority of the instances evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The cause of global warming is the existence of greenhouse gases that trap the emitted infrared wave and cause the increasing of the earth's temperature. One of the predominant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is CO2. Biosequestration by utilizing micro algae is one of the promising method to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. This research focuses on the modeling of the algal growth which is one of the parameter that defines the amount of CO2 which can be fixated by algal. From the observation data, the growth behavior is modeled by regression method, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. To optimize the algorithm, MLP is also combined with The Canonical Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO). The result shows that modeling using MLP-CPSO is more accurate than the original MLP and MLP-PSO respectively by 25% and 15% in RAE. MLP-CPSO also shows the best performance in RMSE with 0.091 and coefficient correlation (r) with 0.92. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Transportation plays an important role in urban development However, the vehicle growth in Indonesia is not supported by the number of road. Due to this fact, traffic congestion is easily occurred, especially in big cities. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has huge contribution to decrease the traffic congestion. In ITS, vehicle detection is one of challenging issue for traffic surveillance. In this paper, adaptive selective background learning and hole filling algorithm are applied to improve the vehicle detection. The validity of the proposed method is tested by using three scenarios and two parameters. The scenarios are bad weather close range (BW-CR), normal weather close range (NW-CR) and normal weather wide range (NW-WR). While, the parameters are the time duration of stopped vehicle detection and the pixel accuracy. Then, the proposed method (Adaptive Selective Background Learning-Hole Filling algorithm) is compared by another previous vehicle detection method. Generally, the result shows that the proposed method yields a significant improvement in vehicle detection. ASBL-HF can detect the stopped and moved vehicle with free noises. Moreover, ASBL-HF has the best accuracy. The accuracy value is about 98.2%. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Currently, microalgae cultivation is one of the most promising alternative solutions to alleviate the value of CO2 concentration. Microalgae growth rate is convinced to be the indicator to measure the effectiveness in capturing CO2. In this paper, the microalgal growth behavior by means of various pH concentrations is observed. From the observation data, the growth behavior is modeled by regression graphs using single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN). To train and test the data, extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is applied. Recently, ELM is approved to be the fastest algorithm to learn an SLFN for regression. ELM is also well-known for its high learning accuracy as various activation functions can be applied in hidden layer. Yet the over-fitting in regression is still an issue in ELM. Thus to alleviate this problem cross-validation method is employed. To optimize the algorithm, ELM is also combined with Genetic Algorithm. The result shows that regression using ELM-GA is more accurate than ELM in various numbers of neurons. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information extraction using distributed sensors has been widely used to obtain information knowledge from various regions or areas. Vehicle traffic data extraction is one of the ways to gather information in order to get the traffic condition information. This research intends to predict and visualize the traffic conditions in a particular road region. Traffic data was obtained from Department of Transport UK. These data are collected using hundreds of sensors for 24 h. Thus, the size of data is very huge. In order to get the behavior of the traffic condition, we need to analyze the huge dataset which was obtained from the sensors. The uses of conventional data mining methods are not sufficient to use, due to the process of knowledge building that should store data temporary in the memory. The fact that data is continuously becoming larger over time, therefore we need to find a method that could automatically adapt to process data in the form of streams. We use method called FIMT-DD (Fast Incremental Model Trees-Drift Detection) to analyze and predict the very large traffic dataset. Based on the prediction system that we have developed, we also visualize the prediction of traffic flow condition within generated sensor point in the real map simulation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	<dc:abstract>There is a necessity in traffic control system using camera to have the capability to discriminate between an object and non-object in the image. One of the procedure to discriminate between those two is usually performed by background subtraction. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is popular method that has been employed to tackle the problem of background subtraction. However, the output of GMM is a rather noisy image which comes from false classification. This situation may arise because several conditions in the video input such as, waving trees, rippling water, and illumination changes. In this paper, an enhanced version of GMM technique which is combined with Hole Filling Algorithm (HF) is proposed to alleviate those problems. The experimental result shows that the proposed method improved the accuracy up to 97.9% and Kappa statistic up to 0.74. This result has outperformed many similar methods that is used for evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this proposed integrated Intelligent Transport System, GPS enabled smart phones, and video cameras are used as traffic sensors, while Twitter is used as verifier. They are attractive because they are non intrusive, and consequently more practical and cheaper to implement. Our novel Virtual Detection Zone (VDZ) method has been able to map match by using pre-determined check points. VDZ speed accuracy ranges from 93.4 to 99.9% in higher speeds and it only needs one longitude and latitude coordinate, to form a detection aware zone. Also by using ANFIS we show that a more accurate traffic condition can be obtained using our three sources of data.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>CCTV is one of the tools that can be used to extract the needed traffic Information. Extracted information from image sequences of CCTV can give us real information about the number of passing vehicles and vehicles speed. In this paper we propose a new method in detecting the number of vehicles and vehicle speed measurement in low light conditions. Headlight detection is used in order to identify the existing vehicle. There are few steps in order to extract the information from CCTV. First for vehicle headlight detection, the vehicles are detected with normalized cross-correlation method and centroid-area-difference. The second step is vehicle tracking. Headlight is used to track the movements of the vehicle. The third step is vehicle counting and vehicle speed measurement; pin-hole and euclidean distance methods are used to estimate the vehicle speed. We have compared the vehicle detection algorithm and vehicle counting-speed measurement. The result shows that the normalized cross correlation method has a higher accuracy than area-centroid difference. The pinhole model also is better in estimating vehicle speed compared to euclidean distance. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Vehicle speed estimation using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is one of the interesting issues in the field of computer vision. Various approaches are used to perform automation in vehicle speed estimation using CCTV. In this study, the use of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for vehicle detection has been improved with the hole-filling method (HF). The speed estimation of the vehicles with various scenarios has been done, and gives the best estimation with the deviation of 7.63 Km/hr. GMM fusion with hole-filling algorithm combined with Pinhole models have shown the best results compared with results using other scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Extractive summarization is a widely studied and fairly easy to implement technique. It works by choosing the most important parts of a document(s) as a summary. However, this can lead to a lack of coherence in the summary itself. In this study, the principle of continuity in Centering Theory is used to maintain the entity coherence between subsequent sentences obtained from extractive news summarizer. Simultaneously, the relative order of sentences belonging to the same source document is maintained. These two considerations are implemented as fitness functions for a genetic algorithm that is used to obtain the optimal ordering of sentences in the summary. Based on the results of our study involving human judgment, a weighted fitness function combining 75% continuity and 25% relative order yields the most acceptable sentence ordering. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

However, IXP is not accompanied by complete procedures and tools needed by developer. Rational Unified Process (RUP) comes as a software development process that is flexible to other framework to be applied in. RUP provides clear steps and responsibilities in the development of software. We propose the framework to get a method that suitable for large organization and provide convenience to developers by combining IXP practice and RUP. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Social commerce is widely used for people who like to socialize while shopping online. However, currently shopping on social commerce has some risk such as especially for security since social commerce platform could not cover end-to-end online transaction process in its platform. Ecommerce on the other hand, could still be relied on to ensure the security and ease of transactions. This characteristic might encourage user to switch from social commerce to e-commerce. This study aims to understand complete understanding of factors that influence user to migrate with push-pull-mooring (PPM) model. The model was used the evaluate the factor the drive user to leave social commerce (push factor), the factor that attract user to migrate to e-commerce (pull factor) and factor that can facilitate or hinder the buyer to switch (mooring factor). This study uses a quantitative approach with collecting data using an online survey filled by 1,271 consumers who have shopped online through social commerce and ecommerce. The process of data analysis uses PLS-SEM with SmartPLS (v. 3.2.8). The results of this study indicate that push factors including familiarity have a positive influence in encouraging consumers to leave social commerce, while the pull factor consists of a security concern and ease of use that positively influence consumers in using e-commerce. Meanwhile, mooring factors which consist of hedonic motivations, habit, and facilitating conditions positively influence the intention to switch. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The focus of this study is to identify factors that affecting the desires of investors or lenders to invest in Indonesian Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through the service provider peer-To-peer lending (P2P lending). This is because there are P2P lending that could not raise funds amounts required by the borrower (SMEs) in full and within the given deadline. This research uses quantitative method using survey to 214 respondents and data is analyzed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. Result of analysis from this research identified the factors that influence investors' desire to invest in Indonesian SMEs namely perceived risk and investor trust to P2P lending platform (platform trust). Perceived risk factors inversely proportional to the level of investors' desire to invest capital. While the platform factor is directly proportional to the desire of investors to invest capital. Thus, it can be concluded that the less risk potentially arise and the higher investors' confidence in the P2P lending platform, the higher the investors' desire to invest. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, it is common for us to complaint about the service or product by using social media platform. Organizations are usually having their customer service or public relation to maintain their social media account such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook or other platforms. This study aims to analyze perceived justice in complaint handling process through social media and its impact towards customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is evaluated together with trust and perceived product quality for their influence in e-WOM and continues usage. The sample of the study is customer of a telecommunication company who is the follower of its customer care account in Twitter. The questionnaires were distributed online, and 238 valid response were analyzed using CB-SEM. The results show that, customers would be satisfied if the complaint handling process is accurate and quick (procedural justice) and supported by compensation (distributive justice). The satisfaction would increase customer trust and perceived product quality and eventually increase their intention to continue using the service and spread positive e-WOM. © 2019 IADIS Press.

	<dc:abstract>This study discusses the acceptance of mobile payment in Indonesia using the case study of mobile payment YAP. The model used in the research is TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) and the analysis process uses SEM-PLS (Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square). This research is a quantitative research by using analysis of primary data in the form of questionnaires distributed to all of YAP users. The results of the study show that a person's main factor in using the YAP mobile payment services is influenced by one's experience in using mobile payment services (at least toward using) and social influence from other person (perceived social influence). The expected experience is supported by the perception of benefits from the mobile payment services. This perception of benefits is influenced by the level of ease and degree of conformity of a person's habits in making payment transactions. This can be used by mobile payment service providers to create services with applications that are easy to use, convenient, and have the power of interest for users such as giving a gimmick to certain payment transactions. © 2019 IADIS Press.

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to analyze and develop a framework that can be used to assess a SMEs’ company’s readiness to implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). This study used qualitative approach with empirical study on relevant researches and case studies at three SMEs manufacturing company in Indonesia. Correspondent from the case study companies are top management officers that will be involved in ERP implementation process. Result from this study is an assessment framework that can be used to assess company’s readiness to implement ERP system. This model consists of three domains, namely technology (e.g. system change, infrastructure, relative benefits, ease-of-use, innovation result, sources, team assignation, team creation, and knowledge and skill), organizational (e.g. aligned objective, process change, top management support, scope, risk planning, feasibility study, consultant, company’s size, and project manager), and environment (e.g. culture, decision making mechanism, communication, competitor, industry type, and partner and target market). The readiness framework then implemented to evaluate the readiness of SME’s and the result shows that the readiest domain is technological and followed by organizational and environment domain. Organizations need to improve their system change, risk planning, feasibility study, communication and partner and target market process to increase the readiness because those indicators are the lowest readiness rate in each domain. © 2018 IADIS.

	<dc:abstract>The development of e-Commerce triggers the use of e-Payment as a payment instrument in online shops. XYZ company as one of the payment solution provider in Indonesia developed an electronic money product named e-Money M. By the end of 2014, e-Money M users had only reached 1.25% of total users targeted in the business plan. This research is intended to identify the barriers and challenges e-Money M. Data was collected through questionnaires and interviews. The survey respondents are 125 e-Money M users. The qualitative data was collected through interviews to the e-Money M development team and customers. The research evaluated six challenges and barriers of e-Money M implementation namely user acceptance, security, infrastructure, socio-cultural factor, user convenience and user preference. The result from the questionnaires show that user preference is the most significant barrier faced by e-Money M implementation. From the interviews, we found the reasons of lack user tendency choosing e-Money M are the limitation of merchants, limitation of access method and limitation of transaction channel. From management view, it was found that e-Money M has difficulty in acquiring customers caused by lack of experience in B2C business and competitor's strength customer's base. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Due to the ease and cost of developing IoT devices as well as to the high adoption rate of smart connected things, the IoT ecosystem is expected to grow continually. Some IoT applications are already on the market, such as in a smart home, wearable, connected vehicle, medical and healthcare, smart grids, and so on. However, the increasing use of IoT, especially in the individual domain, causes the opening of security vulnerabilities. Various studies have attempted to identify security issues on IoT. Many studies indicate that data privacy is one of the primary considerations in IoT because of the high possibility of creating security risks, such as unauthorized access, tapping, data modification, data forgery and so on. Some IoT services and applications provide personal and sensitive information openly and can be misused because of the leakage of data to third parties. Several studies state that the enforcement mechanism of IoT is still inadequate. Besides, there are issues such as identification problems, authentication and authorization, and cross-device dependencies. From the various vulnerabilities, threat sources have been identified by previous researchers apart from bad manufacturers and outside parties, namely IoT users themselves as owners of devices that intentionally or unintentionally provide access to sensitive information. From that case, user awareness becomes a critical aspect of the IoT ecosystem. Some countries are known to have prepared themselves with strategies and master plans in dealing with the IoT era. This study seeks to identify what efforts have been made by the government and other stakeholders in promoting IoT security for end-users in various countries and what best practices can be learned from existing initiatives, and what aspects might still need further research. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

	<dc:abstract>As the Internet of Things (IoT) era raise, billions of additional connected devices in new locations and applications will create new challenges. Security and privacy are among the major challenges in IoT as any breaches and misuse in those aspects will have the adverse impact on users. Among many factors that determine the security of any system, human factor is the most important aspect to be considered; as it is renowned that human is the weakest link in the information security cycle. Experts express the need to increase cyber resilience culture and a focus on the human factors involved in cybersecurity to counter cyber risks. The aim of this study is to propose a conceptual model to improve cyber resilience in IoT users that is adapted from a model in public health sector. Cyber resilience is improved through promoting security behavior by gathering the existing knowledge and gain understanding about every contributing aspects. The proposed approach is expected to be used as foundation for government, especially in Indonesia, to derive strategies in improving cyber resilience of IoT users. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the critical requirement in managing security of any computing system is access control, which includes protection and access management to the available resources. This requirement becomes more strict especially in a distributed computing environment that consists of constrained devices such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M). New challenges in access control are identified in a system comprises a group of distributed multiple M2M gateways forming a so called M2M local cloud platform (Vallati et al. in Wirel Trans Commun 87(3):1071–1091, 2016). Scalability is obviously a necessity which is lacking in some existing access control system. In addition, flexibility in managing access from users or entity belonging to other authorization domains as well as delegating access right are not provided as an integrated features. Lately, the capability-based access control has been suggested as method to manage access for M2M as the key enabler of Internet of Things. In this paper, a capability based access control equipped with Elliptic Curve Cryptography based key management is proposed for the M2M local cloud platform. The feasibility of the proposed capability based access control and key management are tested by implementing them within the security manager that is part of the overall component of the platform architecture, and evaluating their performances by a series of experimentations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The advance of Internet and smart devices, which is often called Internet of Things (IoT), has made the interaction between virtual and physical worlds to be more seamless. IoT allows the information collected by smart devices to be transmitted to the people across the globe through Internet and enhancing people's lives in many aspects, such as health, energy, transportation, etc. In IoT, the communication between device-to-device or device-to-people very often go through different domains each having separate trust authority. Therefore, maintaining trust in the federated network of IoT is really important. However, IoT is vulnerable to numerous threats like tampering of information and key distribution issue, while considering the constraint in its resource. This paper proposes a method to secure communication that manages trust of IoT in federated fashion while minimizing usage of resources in IoT devices. Other aspects of loosely/tightly coupled network federation, dynamic nature of IoT devices in the network and the security analysis will also be discussed in the paper. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Bitcoin is an emerging financial technology that is gaining a lot of popularity all over the world and starting to change the way people make financial transaction. In Indonesia however, bitcoin is more famous for its negative issue, such as money laundering, rather than its usage in financial transaction. One interesting fact to observe is the absence of regulations that explicitly governs the usage of bitcoins. This paper analyzes the factors influencing Indonesian authorities in defining regulations for bitcoins and how the existing regulations left open some opportunities for a bad guy to perform money laundering with the help of bitcoins. A qualitative approach is used in this research for data collection and analysis. Interview with two experts representing bitcoin exchange company and legal consultant was conducted in data collection. The outcome of this research is to find out vulnerabilities in bitcoin that allows money laundering and give suggestions on how to prevent money laundering with bitcoin from the perspective of regulations and bitcoin company in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology is one of the key enablers of Internet of Things (IoT) vision which allows communication among smart things in the network and the back end system. Ensuring security through proper key management utilization is without a doubt an important requirement of any M2M system. This paper proposed a key management scheme based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the M2M local cloud platform which consists of multiple gateways, which provides scalability to the distributed architecture of the platform while suitable for the low powered device. The scheme has been implemented as part of the M2M platform and its performance has been evaluated. The analysis of the evaluation results in terms of processing time to perform various operations will be discussed. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Managing access to and protecting resources is one of the important aspect in managing security, especially in a distributed computing system such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M). One such platform known as the M2M local cloud platform, referring to BETaaS architecture [1], which conceptually consists of multiple distributed M2M gateways, creating new challenges in the access control. Some existing access control systems lack in scalability and flexibility to manage access from users or entity that belong to different authorization domains, or fails to provide fine grained and flexible access right delegation. Recently, the capability based access control has been considered as method to manage access in the Internet of Things (IoT) or M2M domain. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a proposed secure capability based access control in the M2M local cloud platform is presented. The implementation of the proposed capability based access control is within the security manager which is part of the overall building block of the platform. The experiment is carried out to evaluate the functionality and performance of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population. Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The integration of everyday objects into the Internet represents the foundation of the forthcoming Internet of Things (IoT). Smart objects will be the building blocks of the next generation of applications that will exploit interaction between machines to implement enhanced services with minimum or no human intervention in the loop. A crucial factor to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications is a horizontal service infrastructure that seamlessly integrates existing IoT heterogeneous systems. The authors present BETaaS, a framework that enables horizontal M2M deployments. BETaaS is based on a distributed service infrastructure built on top of an overlay network of gateways that allows seamless integration of existing IoT systems. The platform enables easy deployment of applications by exposing to developers a service oriented interface to access things (according to a Things-as-a-Service model) regardless of the technology and the physical infrastructure they belong to. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Building the Environment for Things as a Service (BETaaS) is a novel platform for the deployment and execution of content-centric M2M applications, which relies on a local cloud of gateways. BETaaS platform provides a uniform interface and services to map content with things in a context-aware manner. Deployment of services for the execution of applications is dynamic and takes into account the computational resources of the low-end physical devices used. To this aim, BETaaS platform is based on a suitable defined IoT model, allowing the integration of the BETaaS components within the future Internet environment.

	<dc:abstract>Access control management is a very challenging task in an inter-enterprise RFID system due to huge amounts of information about things or objects that can be collected and accessed to and from the system. Furthermore, the information stored in the inter-enterprise RFID system contains sensitive and confidential data related to the activities of the organization involved around the RFID system. Hence, the efficiency and high-granularity are critical in the design of access control for such system. This paper presents a novel access control model which is efficient and fine grained for such a system. A detail definition and mechanism of the access control model are described in the paper. A system implementation is developed for the evaluation purpose. An important performance measure in big data processing is delay in processing time, thus the evaluation aims at measuring the access control processing time. The evaluation results show that the model is consistent, and is able to achieve less delay than the inter-enterprise RFID system without access control at a certain point. © 2014 River Publishers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Protection and access control to resources plays a critical role in a distributed computing system like Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and cloud platform. The M2M local cloud platform considered in this paper, consists of multiple distributed M2M gateways that form a local cloud - presenting a unique challenge to the existing access control systems. The most prominent access control systems, such as ACL and RBAC, lack in scalability and flexibility to manage access from users or entity that belong to different authorization domains, and thus unsuitable for the presented platform. The access control approach based on API keys and OAuth that is used by the existing M2M Cloud platform, fails to provide fine grained and flexible access right delegation at the same time when both methods are used together. The proposed approach is built upon capability-based access control that has been specifically designed to provide flexible, yet restricted, access rights delegation. A number of use cases are provided to show the usage of capability creation, delegation, and access provision, particularly in the way application accesses services provided by the platform. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Current environmental measurement platforms consist of a large number of networked cyber-physical systems, which are interconnected according to different Internet of Things scenarios. It is likely that large telemetry systems have several hundreds of RTUs that are sending data to be processed by intelligence algorithms and stored in a resilient database that is accessible via Web interface on the Internet. The paper proposes to use the recent technologies of Cloud systems and Big Data processing in order to implement a telemetry application for viticulture. In this paper we present the general architecture and methodology for using SlapOS, an open source provisioning and billing system for distributed cloud computing, used to gather centrally environmental information from different sensors at remote observation points. Finally, the main findings for viticulture applications are presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The addressing and networking are amongst the most important issues in order to make the Internet of Things (IoT) concept a reality. In the Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) based IoT context, the most challenging issue is on the integration of the RFID network into the Internet Protocol (IP) network. The development of the RFID technology, which is driven mainly by the logistic related industries, is based on enterprise system that does not take full advantage of the IP based networking features, such as the mobility management. On the other hand, most of the existing works towards the integration of RFID and IP network do not take the full advantage of all the RFID middleware components defined in the EPCglobal standard. Therefore, the full integration of RFID middleware with the IP network through a testbed implementation which is fully compliance with the EPCglobal standard and having the location and mobility management at the same time, is the main contribution of this work. The performance of our proposed work is measured in terms of delay in two cases, i.e. tags registration and tracking, and thereafter it is compared with the existing RFID middleware implementation. The measurement results show that the delay of our proposed work is significantly lower than that of existing solution, especially in the tags registration case. © 2013 NICT.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A distributed M2M local cloud platform which consists of distributed M2M gateways, needs to be equipped with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor its resources against security attacks, especially from the insider, e.g. another gateway within the local cloud. In this paper, the interaction between rational attacker and defender in the context of an M2M local cloud platform as a multi-stage Bayesian game is studied. In this game formulation, a defender is able to update its belief upon the maliciousness of the attacker. The feasible Nash equilibrium of the game is reviewed and an analytical framework for the rational attacker and defender is provided for a given set of resources with different security values under some constraints on the attack and monitor resources. In the numerical analysis, it can be shown that by having multiple resources to be attacked and/or monitored simultaneously provides a kind of diversity which helps to improve the belief update of the defender. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming integral and mandatory part of everyday life. Scalability and manageability is intimidating due to unbounded number of devices and services. Access control and authorization in IoT with least privilege is important to establish secure communication between multiple devices and services. In this paper, the concept of capability for access control is introduced where the identities of the involved devices are entrenched in the access capabilities. Identity driven capability based access control (ICAC) scheme presented in this paper helps to alleviate issues related to the complexity and dynamics of device identities. ICAC is implemented for Wi-Fi and results shows that ICAC is scalable and performs better compared to other access control schemes. The ICAC evaluation by using security protocol verification tool shows that ICAC is secure against man-in-the-middle attack, especially eavesdropping and replay attacks. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Flexibility is an important property for general access control system and especially in the Internet of Things (IoT), which can be achieved by access or authority delegation. Delegation mechanisms in access control that have been studied until now have been intended mainly for a system that has no resource constraint, such as a web-based system, which is not very suitable for a highly pervasive system such as IoT. To this end, this paper presents an access delegation method with security considerations based on Capability-based Context Aware Access Control (CCAAC) model intended for federated machine-to-machine communication or IoT networks. The main idea of our proposed model is that the access delegation is realized by means of a capability propagation mechanism, and incorporating the context information as well as secure capability propagation under federated IoT environments. By using the identity-based capability-based access control approach as well as contextual information and secure federated IoT, this proposed model provides scalability and flexibility as well as secure authority delegation for highly distributed system. © 2012 NiCT.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) become discretionary part of everyday life and could befall a threat if security is not considered before deployment. Authentication and access control in IoT is equally important to establish secure communication between devices. To protect IoT from man in middle, replay and denial of service attacks, the concept of capability for access control is introduced. This paper presents Identity establishment and capability based access control (IECAC) protocol using ECC (Elliptical Curve Cryptography) for IoT along with protocol evaluation, which protect against the aforementioned attacks. The protocol evaluation by using security protocol verification tool shows that IECAC is secure against these attacks. This paper also discusses performance analysis of the protocol in terms of computational time and compared with other existing solutions. © 2012 NiCT.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the last few years the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen widespread application and can be found in each field. Authentication and access control are important and critical functionalities in the context of IoT to enable secure communication between devices. Mobility, dynamic network topology and weak physical security of low power devices in IoT networks are possible sources for security vulnerabilities. It is promising to make an authentication and access control attack resistant and lightweight in a resource constrained and distributed IoT environment. This paper presents the Identity Authentication and Capability based Access Control (IACAC) model with protocol evaluation and performance analysis. To protect IoT from man-in-the-middle, replay and denial of service (Dos) attacks, the concept of capability for access control is introduced. The novelty of this model is that, it presents an integrated approach of authentication and access control for IoT devices. The results of other related study have also been analyzed to validate and support our findings. Finally, the proposed protocol is evaluated by using security protocol verification tool and verification results shows that IACAC is secure against aforementioned attacks. This paper also discusses performance analysis of the protocol in terms of computational time compared to other existing solutions. Furthermore, this paper addresses challenges in IoT and security attacks are modelled with the use cases to give an actual view of IoT networks. © 2013 River Publishers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposes a novel admission control (AC) algorithm for guaranteed quality of service (QoS) to all users. The proposed solution provides better utilization of system capacity using adaptive modulation (AM). A scheduler based on a per user priority function is also given in this paper. The AC is given by allocating the exact number of slots for each user that will meet its QoS. For every new user the number of slots required to meet its service requirements is estimated based on its channel quality information (CQI), packet arrival rate and buffer length. Using the average QoS achieved, the satisfaction index (SI) and priority is calculated for every user, which is used as key input for the scheduler. Further, the resource allocation in time and frequency for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDMA) systems is also discussed based on user satisfaction and number of slots required for each user. Finally, the proposed design is validated with OFDMA systems, but can be extended to any wireless system. ©2010 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Mining sequence patterns in form of n-grams (sequences of words that appear consecutively) from a large text data is one of the fundamental parts in several information retrieval and natural language processing applications. In this work, we present Spark-gram, a method for large scale frequent sequence mining based on Spark that was adapted from its equivalent method in MapReduce called Suffix-σ. Spark-gram design allows the discovery of all n-grams with maximum length σ and minimum occurrence frequency τ, using iterative algorithm with only a single shuffle phase. We show that Spark-gram can outperform Suffix-σ mainly when τ is high but potentially worse when the value of σ grows higher. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Named Entity Recognition or NER is one of the sub-research field of Information Extraction which can be used for machine translation, question answering, semantic web, etc. One of the biggest challenge of NER is the adversity to construct a manually labeled training data. In this work, we present a semi-supervised approach for Indonesian language NER which is capable of creating high quality training data automatically. Semi-supervised approach works by utilizing unlabeled data made from Wikipedia and DBPedia to form high accuracy and non-redundant additional training data for each iteration of semi-supervised process. We show that our system manages to generate new training data and gain an increasing F1 score as the iteration of semi-supervised process goes. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes the development of an Indonesian NER system using online data such as Wikipedia 1 and DBPedia 2. The system is based on the Stanford NER system [8] and utilizes training documents constructed automatically from Wikipedia. Each entity, i.e. word or phrase that has a hyperlink, in the Wikipedia documents are tagged according to information that is obtained from DBPedia. In this very first version, we are only interested in three entities, namely: Person, Place, and Organization. The system is evaluated using cross fold validation and also evaluated using a gold standard that was manually annotated. Using cross validation evaluation, our Indonesian NER managed to obtain precision and recall values above 90%, whereas the evaluation using gold standard shows that the Indonesian NER achieves high precision but very low recall. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes efforts to develop an online repository of Indonesian corpora -and its associated functions and services- that has been designed to support a wide variety of use cases and applications. Two design considerations are ensuring sustainability and accessibility of the corpora, and enabling open enrichment through annotation. The presented model supports OLAC-compliant metadata, is built atop an OAIS-compliant core repository, and exposes data and functionality via RESTful web services. A prototype implementation is presented, which allows users to upload, browse, and search the collection, whose extensible content model currently supports POS tagging. The future plan is for language-independent aspects of the system to be packaged up and released as an open-source package to aid the development of corpora repositories for other languages. © 2010 by Ruli Manurung, Bayu Distiawan, and Desmond Darma Putra.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA) are the basic elements that make up a whole section of an individual. The basic elements store information that is unique to each individual and will be passed down the generations. DNA also helps in identifying the father in paternity testing, locating missing person investigations, identifying victims in mass disasters. Identification of the victims has a problem if the comparison the father and mother no instance the victim’s parents have died or are very far away from where the victim. Therefore, it is necessary to try to identify Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Inference of live family such as sibling, grandfather/grandmother, uncle/aunt, cousin and nephew. In this paper, we performed a method to measure the similarity of human DNA profiles using fuzzy similarity. In this fuzzy system, DNA profile data is used as an input that stores human identity along with its DNA profile. The data entered is the result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification which is an electropherogram consisting of 16 loci with two alleles for each locus. Output in this fuzzy system is the value of individual similarity with reference and with similarity levels, namely small, medium and high.

	<dc:abstract>The classification of tribal information data is useful to narrow the scope of the investigation into a particular tribal domain so that the process of DNA profile identification can be done with less amount of data so that it can be done with a faster time. In this study we proposed fuzzy inference and also proposed the function of probability density of allele markers as a function of fuzzy membership. The DNA profile has two alleles derived from the parent, based on this case then the presentation of the probability density function of each locus in a tribe is made in two models of membership function, ie the membership function of the independent allele model and in-paired model allele membership function. The experimental results show that the percentage accuracy of in-paired model allele membership function is better than the independent allele model membership function. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Gaussian Fuzzy Number for STR-DNA Similarity Calculation Involving Familial and Tribal Relationships</dc:title>
	<dc:type>Article</dc:type>
	<dc:source>Advances in Bioinformatics</dc:source>
	<dc:abstract>We performed locus similarity calculation by measuring fuzzy intersection between individual locus and reference locus and then performed CODIS STR-DNA similarity calculation. The fuzzy intersection calculation enables a more robust CODIS STR-DNA similarity calculation due to imprecision caused by noise produced by PCR machine. We also proposed shifted convoluted Gaussian fuzzy number (SCGFN) and Gaussian fuzzy number (GFN) to represent each locus value as improvement of triangular fuzzy number (TFN) as used in previous research. Compared to triangular fuzzy number (TFN), GFN is more realistic to represent uncertainty of locus information because the distribution is assumed to be Gaussian. Then, the original Gaussian fuzzy number (GFN) is convoluted with distribution of certain ethnic locus information to produce the new SCGFN which more represents ethnic information compared to original GFN. Experiments were done for the following cases: people with family relationships, people of the same tribe, and certain tribal populations. The statistical test with analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows the difference in similarity between SCGFN, GFN, and TFN with a significant level of 95%. The Tukey method in ANOVA shows that SCGFN yields a higher similarity which means being better than the GFN and TFN methods. The proposed method enables CODIS STR-DNA similarity calculation which is more robust to noise and performed better CODIS similarity calculation involving familial and tribal relationships. © 2018 Maria Susan Anggreainy et al.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Identification of individual STR-based individuals is required for the investigation of Disaster Victim Identification and other applications. The DNA identification of an individual with the DNA of both biological parents, father, and mother, would result in a perfect match value, but what if the biological parents of the individual had died. In this research, we proposed a method of identifying DNA against an individual if one or both of the individual parents were absent, so it was necessary to match the individual DNA profiles with DNA profiles of existing family members. The conclusions from the results of individual DNA matching with DNA of family members were proposed using fuzzy inference system with weighted suggestion according to familial closeness. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper reports the feasibility of employing the recent approach on kernel learning, namely the multiple kernel learning (MKL), for time series forecasting to automatically select the optimal lag length or size of sliding windows. MKL is an approach to choose suitable kernels from a given pool of kernels by exploring the combination of multiple kernels. In this paper, we extend the MKL capability to select the optimal size of sliding windows for time series domain by adopting the data integration approach which has been previously studied in the domain of image processing. In this study, each kernel represents the different lengths of time series lag. In addition, we also examine the feasibility of MKL for decomposed time series. We use the dataset from previous time series competitions as our benchmark. Our experimental results indicate that our approaches perform competitively compared to the previous methods using the same dataset. Furthermore, MKL may predict the detrended time series without explicitly computing the seasonality. The advantage of our method is in its ability in automatically selecting the optimal size of sliding windows and finding the pattern of time series. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>subset of Java's constructs is intended to provide a collection of rules that can be used as a reference in developing a model of code translator from a PROMELA model to a Java program. The idea arises from the fact that, both PROMELA model and Java program are built (or composed) by various elementary elements called constructs. Although this kind of association has already been introduced in some previous researches, they provided no proofs about its correctness. In this paper we propose a formal proof of association's correctness by showing the equivalence (or similarity) of the program graphs for every two associated constructs in the association. The correctness of association means that every two associated constructs in association have equivalent semantics. In addition, at the end of this paper we also introduce a translator tool we have developed based on this association's definition to translate PROMELA model to Java program.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Machine Learning methods such as Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been studied extensively for time series forecasting. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) which utilizes SVR as the predictor is yet another recent approaches to choose suitable kernels from a given pool of kernels by means of a linear combination of some base kernels. However, some literatures suggest that this linear combination of kernels cannot consistently outperform either the uniform combination of base kernels or simply the best single kernel. Hence, in this paper, other combination method is devised, namely the squared combination of base kernels, which gives more weight on suitable kernels and vice versa. We use time series data having various length, pattern and horizons, namely the 111 time series from NN3 competition, 3003 of M3 competition, 1001 of Ml competition and reduced 111 of Ml competition. Our experimental results indicate that our new forecasting approaches using squared combination of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) may perform well compared to the other methods on the same dataset. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Semistructured pattern can be formally modeled as Graph Pattern. The most important problem to be solved in mining large semi structured dataset is the scalability of the method. With the successful development of efficient and scalable algorithms for mining frequent itemsets and sequences, it is natural to extend the scope of study to a more general pattern mining problem: mining frequent semistructured patterns or graph patterns. In this paper, we extend the methodology of pattern-growth and develop a novel algorithm called CLS (Canonical Labeling System), which discovers frequent connected subgraphs efficiently using either depth-first search or breadth-first search strategy. A novel canonical labeling system and search order are devised to support efficient pattern growth. CLS has advantages of simplicity and efficiency over other methods since it combines pattern growing and pattern checking into one procedure. Based on CLS, we develop CLS Close to mine closed frequent graphs, which not only eliminates redundant patterns but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuable hidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needs from different users. In this research, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining. © 2008 Science Publications.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Tacit Knowledge is one of the potential assets in developing community-based learning. A problem often encountered is the difficulty in formalizing and articulating the knowledge, and for this reason, a media is required to extract into an easily translated form. This study focuses on explicit forms of knowledge, and as a result, the method employed is the collection of research findings related to tacit knowledge and community learning. Also, these findings were surveyed based on predetermined keywords and analysed into a complete report which can be used as material for decision making especially in the matter of sharing this knowledge in community-based learning. The purpose of this study was to determine the understanding of measuring this knowledge in terms of existing dimensions, such as technical and cognitive. However, in this case, the conditions and processes help inform about tacit with reference to the Community. The survey activity is still limited to its conceptual measurement and has not yet led to implementation in the form of community learning where members can interact directly using text, images, videos and other forms. In addition to using two dimensions of measurement, knowledge can be shared through socialization, externalization, combination and internalization that refer to the Nonaka and Ba models for learning to provide a sense of fun for the community group. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The concept of extended organization is an IT (Information Technology) impact on organization, where organizations become leaner and more adaptive in facing changes. This concept was used by the Provincial Government of the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (DKI Jakarta) on implementing Jakarta Smart City (JSC) to improve public services by collaborating with other parties. As a government institution, DKI Jakarta has limitations and inflexibility in terms of budget, resources, compliance with regulations in managing urban resources, so this collaboration is a way to create new capabilities and values to support new Jakarta, that is efficient and innovative. The research methodology used is qualitative approach by collecting data through documentation studies and interviews. The result of this study are the implementation of extended organization concept in JSC and what challenges do DKI Jakarta faces on implementing it. The implementation of extended organization in JSC presented in a map of capabilities and values provided by each parties. There are 5 (five) challenges faced by JSC, namely the amount of information that must be managed, benefit management, platform interoperability and change management, knowledge management, and many parties who want to work together with JSC. This research is expected to be a lesson learn for other organization especially government institution who want to apply the concept of extended organization. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this study, we considered crypto-governance as a solution for critical problems in private university management: fraud avoidance diplomas, transcripts and diploma supplement. To avoid fraud, it can be done by blockchain technology by the use of University, Company, Traceability, Profit and Policy-making of crypto-governance. Crypto-governance is able to use IBM using hyperledger fabric protocol and private blockchain network. Muhammadiyah Tangerang University (UMT) saved the graduate documents storage manually by human resources. Moreover, it would be wasting time for many tasks, for example when staffs searched database, they would consume a lot of time and the graduate documents were vulnerable to damage in the disaster. Based on the problems above it would face the research questions; how did we keep the graduate documents storage secure and how it could be authentic guaranteed? Blockchain technology with distributed ledger and consensus is considered to overcome this problem. There were 5 steps taken in this research starting from discussing, literature review, analyzing, learning blockchain technology, creating system model and making a conclusion. The conclusions of this study were expected that the data of graduate students could find faster, easily and authentic guaranteed. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The education system continues to evolve from Education 1.0 to Education 4.0. Currently, education has reached the Education 4.0 stage. Education 4.0 requires technological commitment. Learning processes focus on students, not the teacher as in the previous educational system. Learning processes involve other stakeholders such as the industries, the communities, the experts, or the government. Smart Hybrid Learning Method is a learning method that responds to the Education 4.0 system, which is possible to create collaboration among stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to produce a model of Smart Hybrid Learning Method and architectural framework design of Smart Hybrid Learning System using three-layer architecture approach. The Smart Hybrid Learning Method is the evolution of the flipped or inverted classroom method combined with several other learning method approaches, such as Challenge Based Learning and Case Based Learning. Learning can be done inside and outside the classroom. To apply the Smart Hybrid Learning Method, it needs system called Smart Hybrid Learning System, which can be accessed by several stakeholders. The use of three-layer architecture will create flexibility to function and layer in the system. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The objective of this study is to apply cluster analysis on Indonesia's international tourism data set. Algorithm used in this cluster analysis is k-means and the number of cluster (k) is four and the similarity measurement between members of clusters is based on Euclidean distance. The source of data set was taken from Ministry of Tourism portal of Republic of Indonesia per November 2017. The results of this cluster analysis is presented in a table consisting of four clusters and each cluster consists of its members. Cluster analysis in this study can be used more quickly and efficiently to identify countries which will be the promotional and campaign targets on tax-free incentives for foreign tourists assuming a constraint that promotional and campaign budgets are always limited so that the related policy makers need to set a priority on targeted countries. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information Technology (IT) convergance and transformation in the public sector continue to increase that encourage governmental organizations to make IT Governance (ITG) doing well. For public sector, ITG implementation is difficult because it is complex than ITG in the private sector. It is therefore necessary to have ITG mechanisms that align public sector needs especially in creating public value. The literature in ITG implementation in the public sector still does not discuss the ITG mechanisms implementation that align with IT strategy to create public value. Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we find key practices in ITG mechanisms that align with IT strategy in the public sector. These key practices are the basis of the conceptual model of the relationship between IT G mechanisms, strategic IT alignment, and effective public value. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-commerce has proliferated globally, as well as nationally in Indonesia. Unfortunately, Indonesian commodities, including Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) products, have been negatively affected by the increase of imported goods traded on the country's e-marketplace and social commerce. It is a huge challenge as the MSMEs contributed to more than half of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). On the other hand, previous studies indicated that most Indonesian MSMEs have not fully harnessed the potential of e-commerce and social commerce. To address this problem, a research was conducted to understand factors influencing MSMEs in Indonesia adopting e-marketplace and Instagram. E-marketplace was a traditional media for e-commerce, whilst Instagram was identified as a promising social media for business. The research model was constructed based on the Technology, Organization, Environment (TOE) framework. For this context, a questionnaire was designed and distributed to MSMEs in Indonesia. There were 110 valid responses, which were analyzed with Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The statistical findings were followed up by interviews with selected MSMEs as inputs to develop recommendation. The results show that Competitive Pressure, Financial Resources, Perceived Risk, and Top Management Support affect Indonesian MSMEs to adopt e-marketplace. Besides, factors influencing their Instagram adoption are Competitive Pressure, Perceived Benefit, Top Management Support, and Vendor Support. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Jakarta Siaga 112 Emergency Service is an emergency call provided by the government of Special Capital Region of Jakarta to handle emergency calls from the citizens. Jakarta Siaga 112 Emergency Service Management System is run by the staffs of Jakarta government to organize the follow-ups of emergency calls. Referring to the importance of this system, a study was administered to evaluate factors affecting its success. The investigation was conducted based on the DeLone and McLean success model. Data were collected using questionnaires distributed to staffs of Jakarta Government Work Units and agencies, who work together on the system. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Model. The results demonstrate that System Quality, Information Quality, Service Quality, Use, User Satisfaction, and Net Benefits significantly influence the success of this system. However, two out of nine hypotheses are rejected. These are the relationship between System Quality towards Use, as well as Use towards User Satisfaction. Theoretical impact from the research and result is to enrich the diversity of research related to emergency services in the field of information technology. © 2019 IEEE.

	<dc:abstract>Recent customers’ behavior changes require Garuda Indonesia, as the national flag carrier, to deliver more excellent services. Therefore, Garuda Indonesia extends its reservation channel to a mobile application. However, its use is far below the company’s expectation. To address this problem, a study was conducted to determine factors affecting the intention to use it. This investigation was conducted based on the Suki and Suki’s model. User Interface (UI) Attractiveness variable is added to accommodate the importance of UI in mobile applications. This is a quantitative research, which collected data using online questionnaires. There were 101 valid questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method with Smart-PLS. The results show that subjective norm is the most important factor to influence the intention to use Garuda Indonesia’s mobile application. The other important variable are airline image and perceived ease of use. As theoretical implication, this research contributes to confirm the previous related model and as a baseline for research on flight mobile application in Indonesia. Moreover, for practical implication, this research could help Garuda Indonesia to increase the willingness of their potential customers to use its mobile application. © 2019 IEEE.

	<dc:abstract>E-Government aims to deliver benefits to government and citizens by improving transparency, efficiency, trust, and citizen participation. However, e-government initiatives face several barriers. One of them is poor usability. To advance quality of usability, literatures indicate that usability evaluation is a key success factor. There are many approaches to conduct usability evaluation. Each of it has advantages and challenges. On the other hand, there are several aspects that must be considered related to usability evaluation in e-government context. It includes large stakeholders and their diversity, extra needs for ethical practices, as well as high privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the right usability evaluation method in e-government. In order to address this issue, a study using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify the suitable usability evaluation methods. There are 519 literatures that have been selected in the initial stage. It was then followed by an extraction process, which produced 22 selected references. Each method was grouped into usability testing, inspection, and inquiry. These results can guide academics and practitioners to carry out usability evaluation in egovernment. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Governments around the world are working continuously in order to improve services for their citizens. However, the success of these initiatives is dependent not only on the government support but also on the citizens' willingness to use these services. To implement e-government successfully, it is important to determine the factors related to its adoption. This paper examines the adoption factors of e-government services in the entire world, then validate with current research in Indonesia. To identify the adoption factor we use meta-ethnography combining with desk research methodology. In this context, these papers describe and find the influencing adoption factors e-government service in Indonesia. We found 40 studies from journal articles and conference paper that obtain 272 concepts of adoption factors from it. After we reduce and found the similarity between the concepts now we have 96 lists of adoption factors. Those 96 lists of adoption factors are divided into eightdomains i.e. perceived of citizen, government support, technological support, organizational structure, technological acceptance, human resources, other stakeholder support, and culture, and there should become consideration in e-Government service implementation in Indonesia. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recent surveys show that success rate of Information Technology (IT) projects implementation is relatively low i.e. below 50%. It is caused by weak implementation of project management standards and methodologies, which are highly dependent on Project Management Office (PMO). On the other hand, PMO implementation is prone to failures. To address this problem, this study aims to determine the rank of factors influencing PMO success in IT projects in Indonesia. Firstly, a qualitative approach was carried out by a literature study and expert reviews to identify the PMO success factors. Secondly, a quantitative approach was conducted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to model the PMO success criteria and critical success factors (CSF). The results indicate that the top level management support is the most critical factor for the PMO implementation, while the project success is the top rank of success criteria. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Global Software Development (GSD) offers many benefits. On the other hand, it also has several challenges such as its impact on software quality. The implementation of software processes improvement, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), can improve quality of software products. However, CMMI as a process improvement model has been rarely discussed in GSD context. To fill this gap a systematic literature study was conducted by using Kitchenham's method. It investigated GSD research from several databases between 2013-2018. At the end there are 12 selected papers. The findings indicate that CMMI is essential for the success of GSD projects. However, it requires multiple customizations and combinations with other standards. Concept Process Areas (PAs) and maturity level from CMMI are used in new standards Software Process Improvement (SPI) with different approaches. The results of this study are potential as a reference to develop customized CMMI to increase success rate in GSD projects. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The concept of e-commerce adoption has appeared in libraries for decades, but its adoption is slow and partial. In Indonesia, ecommerce is growing rapidly and has the potential to be adopted in various business processes including e-library. The purpose of this study is to develop e-commerce adoption strategies for e-library development in Indonesia. The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was chosen as the main research method to meet the objective. One of the SLR phases is synthesis, which was conduted using the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis. Then SWOT matrix was validated by expert librarians. The findings of this study are summarized as recommendations to enhance mobile-based services, to develop ecommerce business centers, as well as to integrate library loan and payment systems. e-Commerce system in e-library is better developed by professional software vendors to overcome limited software engineers in most libraries. Collaboration with banks is also needed for legal payment. Besides, optimization of library resource subscription and open access collection can be achieved by consortium of several libraries. Promotion of e-commerce adoption in e-library is also important to increase its sustainability. Validation by experts from academic, national, and research librarians refines the SLR results to meet libraries' vision and mission. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>High penetration of social media in Indonesia gives more opportunities for sellers to promote their products, as well as for consumers to buy. Instagram is a popular social media for ecommerce in Indonesia. In 2016 Instagram introduced the Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons to trigger more e-commerce transactions on Instagram. On the other hand, impulse buying of social commerce consumers can be explained by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the CTA buttons on consumers' impulse buying using the S-O-R model. A questionnaire was administered to collect data from 163 consumers. The data were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results were validated by interviews with 3 sellers and 3 consumers. It shows that the CTA buttons have a positive impact on consumers' impulsive purchase, but less effective to improve consumers' perceived enjoyment. The main contribution of this study is the understanding of consumers' impulse buying response on promotional ads feature, which is related to the CTA buttons. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information Systems (IS) development for government is prone to failure, which also happened to the development of Administration and Credit Information Systems (Sistem Informasi Pengadministrasian dan Angka Kredit or SIPARKIT) by the ICT unit at Finance Education and Training Agency (BPPK), Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. This study investigates the Critical Success Factors (CSF) of the SIPARKIT to determine the priority of each CSF. These factors were identified from the literature and interviewed with SIPARKIT development team and experts in IS project management. The CSFs were then ranked using pair wise comparison questionnaire by the IS development team and high rank ICT officers. The data collected from the questionnaires were analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that business process reengineering and system integration are the most important factor for the success of IS development. Other CSFs are project plan and schedule, team skills, competencies, and composition, top management support, and politics within the organization, communication, leadership, performance assessment, and knowledge management. Interviews with top management were also conducted to support the analysis results. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Metacognition plays a significant role in student learning, especially in solving ill-structured problems. Computer science students who are enrolled in a software engineering course or information systems development projects have to complete ill-structured problems, in this case a project that can be solved using more than one solution or approach. Although the course is compulsory, it is important to understand its implementation from cognitive/metacognitive perspective. The objective of the study is to investigate the students' metacognitive skills while working on their information systems projects. We used Engineering Design Metacognitive Questionnaire (EDMQ) as the instrument that is grounded in Butler and Cartier's self-regulated learning (SRL) model. Two early phases in design phases were used, namely Problem Definition and Conceptual Design. One hundred and thirty-four students enrolled in IS Development Project course at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia participated in the study. There are two types of data collected in the study, quantitative and qualitative data. The results found that on average the students often employ metacognitive skills under the following categories: Task Interpretation, Planning Strategies, Cognitive Actions, Monitoring and Fix-Up strategies, and Criteria of Success. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposes a requirement analysis to integrate two information systems used by the Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. The first system is the State Budget and Treasury System called as the SPAN (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara), managed by the General Directorate of Treasury. The second one is the Procurement General Plan Information System called as the SIRUP (Sistem Informasi Rencana Umum Pengadaan), managed by the Government Procurement of Goods and Services Policy Board or known as LKPP (Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa Pemerintah). The two systems enable the procurement and finance management process of the national treasury. However, currently the both systems are not yet integrated, which causes much asymmetric information between the two. This study qualitatively analyses the opportunities to integrate their business processes and data flows, to overcome the current problems. Action research and thematic analysis research methods are used. The authors present the analysis results in two levels data flow diagram. Moreover, this study also analyse the opportunities for the application integration to improve the accountability and accuracy of the government financial management. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Despite limited financial resources of people with minimum wage in Indonesia, they have embraced Financial Technology (fintech). There are two types of fintech, i.e. card-based electronic wallet and application-based digital cash. The aim of this research is to rank the acceptance factors of e-wallet and digital cash by low income individuals. Initially, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to develop a structural hierarchy of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was followed by interviews with fintech experts to validate the structural hierarchy. Finally, AHP pairwise comparison questionnaires were filled out by 18 respondents, who have experiences using electronic wallet or digital cash. The results show that highest reception factor of both fintech types is ease of use. Speed is the second top rank acceptance factor of electronic wallet, whilst cost-benefit is the second factor of digital cash reception. These findings can enable fintech providers to improve their better marketing strategy, by enhancing their products related its ease of use, speed, and cost. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The emergence of digital economy has motivated PT Telkom Indonesia to launch SOBAT-UKM portal. It aims to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia. The portal has an e-consultation feature, which provides online business discussion between business experts and the SMEs. Despite its significant benefits, the utilization of e-consultation feature only reached 10.54% of the yearly target set by PT Telkom. To address this problem, a study was conducted to investigate factors affecting the low users' acceptance. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was used to construct the research model and a questionnaire for data collection. The data were analyzed with Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that the influencing factors are Social Influence, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, User Behavior, and Behavioral Intention. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Personalization in e-commerce has potentials to increase sales, customers' purchase intention and acquisition, as well as improvement of customer interaction. It is understood that personalization is a controllable variable for successful e-commerce. However, previous research on personalization proposed diverse concepts from numerous fields. As a result, it leads to bias construct of e-commerce personalization development and evaluation by academia and industry. To address this gap, a study was conducted to unravel personalization features from various perspectives. A Kitchenham's systematic literature review was used to discover personalization research from Q1/Q2 journals and top conference papers between 2012-2017. A theory-driven approach was administered to extract 21 selected papers. This process classifies personalization features into four dimensions based on three characters i.e objective, method, and user model. They include architectural, relational, instrumental and commercial dimensions. The results show that instrumental and commercial personalizations have been proved as the most popular dimension in the academic literature. However, relational personalization has been consistently rising as a new interesting topic to study since the massive growth of social media data. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, many cities around the world are moving towards the smart city by advancing the utilization of ICT and Depok is one of them. The Scottish Smart City Maturity Model, a smart city framework adapted from the IDC model and British Standard Institution PAS 181, can be used as a reference in determining the concept and direction of a smart city implementation. It identifies and measures the existing condition of a city in order to map the city's capabilities. Smart government, as a blend of technology and innovation, can be described as the next step for e-government. It is identified a vital part of the transformation towards smart city. Hence, this study aims to assess the maturity of the smart government in Depok City. This study adopts the Scottish Smart City Maturity Model using a qualitative approach that includes interviews, observations, and document analysis. This study also performs weigh calculation to determine the importance of the smart government dimension using the Entropy method. The results show that Depok is at level 1 (Ad-hoc) indicating that the city is still focusing on the development and application of ICT and on improving the use of data in its services. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Country Brand Index (CBI) is an index on global perception of a country's image among other countries. In 2012, Indonesia's CBI was ranked 78 from 118 countries, which was lower than the previous years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia have done several efforts to improve the country's image, including social media usage. However, the ministry's social media accounts are not as popular as expected. This indicates the ministry's need of social media strategies for public diplomacy. In order to address this problem, a qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured interview with the ministry's officials and social media experts. Besides, this study employed observations on public diplomacy and social media activities within the ministry. The Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) analysis, McKinsey's 7S Framework, as well as Political, Economic, Social and Technological (PEST) analysis were used to examine the data. The strategy priorities were determined based on Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM). The results indicate five strengths, nine weaknesses, eight opportunities, and six threats for the ministry. The analysis on those factors leads to seventeen social media strategies, which are mapped into six strategic objectives and laid out in a three-year work plan. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information technology plays an important role in telecommunication industry. Their businesses rely on some key software, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), charging and payment gateways. However, telecommunication companies face challenges in maintaining quality of their software. Consequently, software failures happen and these organizations cannot meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It gives bad impact on customers' satisfaction and companies' performance. Therefore, this study examines factors causing the software malfunctions. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to rank these factors. To contextualize the study, a telecommunication company in Indonesia was used as a case. It was found that (1) Computational/Logic Error, (2) Insider Threat, (3) Improper Testing of Change, (4) Configuration Error, (5) Network Hardware Failure (6) Password Disclosures, (7) Denial of Services Attacks were the top rank of software failure roots. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to describe the process of developing a conceptual model in the development of models of E-portfolios for Professional Competency Certification in Indonesia. Stages in the development of conceptual model begin with a review of literature that aims to analyze and evaluate the facts of the previous studies. There are six concepts that will be discussed: (a) Certification of Competence Professional, (b) Factor E-portfolio, (c) the model ICCP E-portfolio, (d) Actor Network Theory, and (e) Recommender System. In the process of Professional Competence Certification in Indonesia, the portfolio is used as a document to evaluate the competence of the workforce, which still uses paper-based portfolios. The paper based portfolio is static and limited in sharing information with others in the management process, evaluation and updating the material is also difficult. It is expected that the conceptual model will contribute to the development of e-portfolio system to be applied in the Professional Competency Certification in Indonesia. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Portfolio is a document describing skills, experience, interest or knowledge of a person. Currently, the conventional portfolio paper-based is no longer able to keep pace with times. Therefore, some researchers suggest e-portfolios overcome this weakness. Previous studies have attempted to create a model of ideal e-portfolios. This includes Shopping Trolley Model, Toast Rack Model, Spinal Column Model, Mixed Cake Model. However, most of the previous studies on e-portfolio are in the education domain. It is rare to find research on e-portfolio for managing certification of professional competence. This study focuses on literature review and previous works on definitions, model, type, and system of e-portfolios. The results of this research are expected to give a contribution on scientific, conceptual, as well as theoretical development in Information Systems. The results on cab are used in further research to define suitable e-portfolio in Indonesia, model, critical success factors and e-portfolio system for ICT professional certification in this country. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>The Use of Analytic Hierarchy Process for Software Development Method Selection: A Perspective of e-Government in Indonesia</dc:title>
	<dc:type>Conference Paper</dc:type>
	<dc:abstract>Information Technology (IT) has played an important role at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemlu). It provides e-government services to cut long bureaucracy and achieve priorities in foreign policies. As the organization grows, there are needs to develop new software in this e-government context. In general, it requires a software development standard procedure to meet software quality assurance. In Kemlu the standard procedure in software development becomes more critical due to frequent changes among IT team members. It is the nature of this organization to send their staffs to foreign countries for several years. Then they are back to home country for another couple of years, and get ready for their next assignments abroad. A fundamental step in a software development standard procedure is determining the most suitable software development method. However, there was lack of investigation for this selection. To address this problem, a study using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted. The factor variables are personnel, requirements, applications, organizations, businesses, operations, and technology. The alternatives of software development methods are Waterfall, Incremental, Prototyping, Extreme Programming, Scrum, and Rational Unified Process. The results show that Prototyping is the fittest software development method for Kemlu. © 2018 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Increasing user acceptance remains as a critical issue to be resolved in the implementation of any new technology. This research aims to empirically distinguish the factors leading to an e-audit system acceptance in the public sector. The theoretical framework used in this study was adapted from Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), as well as external variables gathered from previous studies. In this exploratory research, a total of 71 valid respondents were gathered and analyzed statistically using PLS-SEM. The results confirmed that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly affected system's usage. Furthermore, this research substantiated four external factors that affected systems usage through perceived ease of use, which were, management support, training, support, and computer self efficacy, and one external factor through perceived usefulness, namely, result demonstrability. Whereas user involvement, job relevance, and output quality were deemed to have no effects towards system's usage through perceived usefulness. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Smart home development has many methods that cause the rise of various smart home systems which has its own uniqueness on every system. Nevertheless, those systems could not accommodate their communication and information sharing. It causes the difficulties of collaboration on a system to another, and it makes hard to implement an existing models on a new system. One of solution to answer this problem is to implement ontology. Ontology allows the preparation of structured system that corresponds to a specific character in accordance with the needs of the system. Ontology implementations in Smart Home are expected to ease in managing information and using information. In this research, an ontology is built. The ontology would be mapped from the smart-home object based generic design. We developed a simple system by utilizing the ontology that has been built. Based on the experiment has been done, the ontology has had a consistent structure and appropriate with the smart home system design requirement. Based on tests that we have done, the ontology is easy to be implemented into a system. Besides, with a limited instance, the ontology has been successfully delivered 81.027 % appropriate response with 0.0146 second average response time to the residents activity in the smart home environment. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One way to predict the behavior of smart home lighting is by using machine learning. Currently many methods of supervised learning that used for this problem, one of them is decision tree method. Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) as one of the decision tree method that has advantages in online machine learning that may useful in smart home, but there are still some room of improvisation that can improve accuracy of VFDT. The experiment result is obtained that VFDT is better than Naïve Bayes (NB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in offline and online experiment. In addition, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and improved Laplace correction that is used as improvisation of VFDT is able to increase the accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of VFDT in predicting smart home lighting switch usage. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Pervasive computing environments require applications that reduce user distraction from other tasks. Context-awareness attempts to address this problem by making applications more adaptive and autonomous. Context-aware pervasive systems rely on information about the context and user preferences to guide their behaviour. However, context-aware applications do not always behave as users expect, and can cause users to feel loss of control over their applications. To mitigate these problems, context-aware systems must provide mechanisms to strike a suitable balance between user control and software autonomy. This has implications on the way that middleware for context-aware systems must be designed. Most current middleware solutions for context aware systems support the gathering and management of context information, while some also support the management and evaluation of user preferences; however, few middleware solutions address the issue of providing transparency (to facilitate user understanding of application actions) and user control. This paper describes the most relevant work in this area, as well as ongoing research on extending a previously developed middleware to better support transparency and control.

	<dc:abstract>Application autonomy can reduce interactions with users, ease the use of the system, and decrease user distraction. On the other hand, users may feel loss of control over their applications. A further problem is that autonomous applications may not always behave in the way desired by the user. To mitigate these problems, autonomous context-aware systems must provide mechanisms to strike a suitable balance between user control and software autonomy. In this paper, we present a survey of research on balancing user control and system autonomy in context-aware systems. We address various issues that are related to the control-autonomy trade-off, including issues in context modelling, programming models and tools, and user interface design. © 2006 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Inter-organizational IT/IS implementation must deal not only with the technical complexities across different systems, but also the alignment between strategies and expected functionalities between the involved institutions. This paper aims to uncover the aspirational requirements in the implementation of integrated criminal justice systems (ICJS) in Indonesia. It involved four main agencies: police, prosecutor office, court, and prison, as well as some auxiliary agencies. The research is contrasting the aspiration-based design with rational alignment needs as defined in the classic Strategic Alignment Model. The extension of this classic IT alignment framework provides the inter-relationship discourses between business strategy, business infrastructure, technology strategy, and technology infrastructure in the inter-organizational context. This paper found out that multi-organizational IT alignment framework not always suitable in multi-organizational IT implementation. Improving the alignment inside the respective organization may be provide better answer to address the misaligned situation. This paper also found out that a narrow-focused aspiration should be catered to reach the immediate success. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The implementation of e-archives or e-records systems in public agency is prone to failures and rejections, a similar situation faced by many e-government initiatives. The measurement of readiness level is considered as a necessary step to minimize the implementation failures and users' rejection. This research aims to measure the readiness level of e-archives implementation in Indonesia's National Archives (Arsip Nasional Republik Indonesia) and develop the corresponding recommendations to overcome it. The scope of research is the static archives, both digital-born and digital reborn e-archives. The measurement adopts e-archives readiness measurement frameworks from the International Records Management Trust (IRMT). The adoption was conducted by contextualizing it in the Indonesian context. It is a qualitative research with data collection via series of interviews, desk studies, and researcher's observations. The qualitative data were categorized and analyzed into the set of themes that are related to the level of e-archives implementation readiness. The research finding shows that the readiness level is relatively low, indicating the unreadiness of the National Archives to implement the e-archives initiative. The research then employs Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to develop the recommendations to improve the e-archives readiness at Indonesia's National Archives). © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Analysis of main cause factors and improvement recommendation of IT disaster recovery problems: A case study of XYZ organization</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Disruption of Information Technology (IT) can impede the business of an organization. In this case, major incidents occurred in XYZ organization in which it could not restore the services of business immediately after its data center endured an electrical outage. The speed of services restoration depends on how quickly the organization identifies the incident and how well it is prepared. Therefore, the top level management of XYZ organization expects a tactical and systematic step in anticipating and handling disruptions to all IT services. Based on these conditions, this research aimed to study the main factors of IT disaster recovery problem to provide recommendations for improvement. The IT disaster recovery problem can be identified by 4 (four) factors, which are technology, organization, environment and individual. In order to find out the problem, this study used interviews with respondents who involved in major incident and information from documents related with service recovery. In order to know the factors or sub-factors that significantly affect the recovery of services, this research used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques for weighting factors or sub-factors to obtain influence factor of IT disaster recovery. The AHP result of the highest weighted factor is the organization, and the highest weighted sub-factor is the perception of business continuity benefit. Recommendations were formulated based on literature study and then the result of literature study was validated through Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and experts. The results of this research provide recommendation for improvement of the problems using the most suitable ITIL approach. © 2018 Author(s).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Stemming words to (usually) remove suffixes has applications in text search, machine translation, document summarization, and text classification. For example, English stemming reduces the words "computer," "computing," "computation," and "computability" to their common morphological root, "comput-." In text search, this permits a search for "computers" to find documents containing all words with the stem "comput-." In the Indonesian language, stemming is of crucial importance: words have prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and confixes that make matching related words difficult. This work surveys existing techniques for stemming Indonesian words to their morphological roots, presents our novel and highly accurate CS algorithm, and explores the effectiveness of stemming in the context of general-purpose text information retrieval through ad hoc queries. © 2007 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a novel named entity recognition approach for the Indonesian language. We call the new method InNER for Indonesian Named Entity Recognition. InNER is based on a set of rules capturing the contextual, morphological, and part of speech knowledge necessary in the process of recognizing named entities in Indonesian texts. The InNER strategy is one of knowledge engineering: the domain and language specific rules are designed by expert knowledge engineers. After showing in our previous work that mined association rules can effectively recognize named entities and outperform maximum entropy methods, we needed to evaluate the potential for improvement to the rule based approach when expert crafted knowledge is used. The results are conclusive: the InNER method yields recall and precision of up to 63.43% and 71.84%, respectively. Thus, it significantly outperforms not only maximum entropy methods but also the association rule based method we had previously designed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Optimal scheduling in meta-computing environments still is an open research question. Various resource management (RM) architectures have been proposed in the literature (e.g. [2][13][12]). In the present paper we explore, through simulation, various multi-level scheduling strategies for compound computing environments comprising several clusters of workstations. We study global and local RM and their interaction. The local RM comprises both the cluster management and operating system schedulers. Each level refines the scheduling decisions of the layer above it, taking into account the latest resource information. Our experiments explore conventional strategies like First Come, First Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) at the global RM level. At all levels, the schedulers strive to maintain a good load balance. The unit of load balancing at the global level is the job consisting of one or more parallel tasks; at the local level it is the task. The results of our simulations indicate that, especially at high system loads, the use of a global RM can result in a significant performance gain. © 2001 World Scientific Publishing Company.</dc:abstract>

The algorithm forward packets from guaranteed class-of-service flows into the Expedited Forwarding PHB. The algorithm is assumed to be implemented in a pipelined processor configuration that separate the input and output packet processing functions. The remaining jitter value is used to determine the packet forwarding priority. Measures of throughput and ratio of packet loss are given. From the simulation we learned that this algorithm yields to good packet throughput and tolerable packet loss ratio.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As parallel systems expand in size and complexity, the absence of performance tools for these parallel systems exacerbates the already difficult problems of application program and system software performance tuning. Moreover, given the pace of technological change, we can no longer afford to develop ad hoc, one-of-a-kind performance instrumentation software; we need scalable, portable performance analysis tools. We describe an environment prototype based on the lessons learned from two previous generations of performance data analysis software. Our environment prototype contains a set of performance data transformation modules that can be interconnected in user-specified ways. It is the responsibility of the environment infrastructure to hide details of module interconnection and data sharing. The environment is written in C++ with the graphical displays based on X windows and the Motif toolkit. It allows users to interconnect and configure modules graphically to form an acyclic, directed data analysis graph. Performance trace data are represented in a self-documenting stream format that includes internal definitions of data types, sizes, and names. The environment prototype supports the use of head-mounted displays and sonic data presentation in addition to the traditional use of visual techniques. © 1991 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>To benefit from parallel computers, programs must be partitioned into units that work in parallel. Once partitioned, these units, called processes, tasks or threads, must be assigned to specific processors for execution. On shared memory architectures, this is termed scheduling, while on multicomputer systems, it is called load distribution, distinguishing it from any local scheduling used on individual nodes. We compared several load placement algorithms using instrumented programs and synthetic program models. Salient characteristics of these program traces (total computation time, total number of messages sent and average message size) span two orders of magnitude. Load distribution algorithms determine the initial placement for processes, a precursor to the more general problem of load redistribution. We simulated a modern architecture with point-to-point communication; however, our findings should apply to wormhole networks as well. We found that information is usually better than inference for driving process placement. The strategies we examine use load or status information to select placement locations; this information is explicitly disseminated and also piggybacked on normal communication. We found that extant point-to-point networks reduce the rate of information dissemination because transiting messages are ignored by intermediate nodes. From these studies, we have concluded that desirable workload distribution strategies will place new processes globally, rather than locally, to spread processes rapidly, but that local information should be used to refine global placement. ©1990 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Any new computer system organization raises many questions about hardware, system software, algorithms, and programming; multicomputers are no exception. The commercial emergence of hypercubes has made it possible to move many research questions from theoretical to experimental venues. However, hardware availability does more than permit implementation of previously tested ideas. The feasibility of many application and operating system algorithms can only be determined experimentally. We believe it is difficult, if not impossible, to experimentally examine these issues singly - they interact in both obvious and subtle ways. This paper describes the Picasso hypercube operating system, a part of the Picasso project at the University of Illinois. Motivated by the need for a flexible operating system testbed, the design of Picasso has exposed several important, and necessary, features of multicomputer operating systems designed for research. We present the design and current performance of Picasso, discuss the lessons learned, and conclude with an overview of future research plans.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>From characters to words to in between: Do we capture morphology?</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Words can be represented by composing the representations of subword units such as word segments, characters, and/or character n-grams. While such representations are effective and may capture the morphological regularities of words, they have not been systematically compared, and it is not understood how they interact with different morphological typologies. On a language modeling task, we present experiments that systematically vary (1) the basic unit of representation, (2) the composition of these representations, and (3) the morphological typology of the language modeled. Our results extend previous findings that character representations are effective across typologies, and we find that a previously unstudied combination of character trigram representations composed with bi-LSTMs outperforms most others. But we also find room for improvement: none of the character-level models match the predictive accuracy of a model with access to true morphological analyses, even when learned from an order of magnitude more data. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.</dc:abstract>

The parser uses features from a bidirectional LSTM to produce a distribution over possible heads for each word in the sentence. To allow transfer learning for low-resource treebanks and surprise languages, we train several multilingual models for related languages, grouped by their genus and language families. Out of 33 participants, our system achieves rank 9th in the main results, with 75.49 UAS and 68.87 LAS F-1 scores (average across 81 treebanks). © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.</dc:abstract>

In this paper, we report our study on speech synthesis system for Indonesian language. The speech synthesis system uses HMM which have proven to be an efficient parametric model to synthesize speech waveform. In this study, we analyze the effect of syllable and word stress on the quality of synthesized speech. Result shows that the use of syllable and word stress can improve the quality of the synthesized speech with MOS level for about 67.3% and word accuracy level for about 0.01%. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesian Language Sign System (SIBI) is the official sign language system used in Indonesia. A model that could translate SIBI gesture taken from a video would be very useful for communicating with people with disabilities. One of the features needed to translate SIBI gesture to words is the subject’s skeleton. In this paper, we researched a method to extract this feature from 2-Dimensional video. The method reconstructs skeleton model based on the position of head, shoulders, elbows, and hands of the subject. The head is located with haar cascade and the shoulders are pinpointed based on the location of the head. The hands are located with skin segmentation technique and then tracked throughout the video with Lucas-Kanade method. The elbows are extrapolated based on the shoulder and hand points, and the body silhouette. The experiment with LSTM model resulted in maximum testing accuracy of 98.214%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we propose a method of feature extraction applied to the hands, fingers and arms, intended to improve the accuracy of Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia (SIBI) gesture recognition. Using common smartphone camera, we recorded multiple sequence of gestures used to sign for affixes and root words in SIBI then applied image processing and tracking methods to extract features from the shape and location of the hands. To extract the features, skin color segmentation was applied to separate hands and face blob from the background. Then the object would be registered to an ellipse model and tracked through the videos using elliptical model tracking. Finally, the video was then processed frame by frame, and each successfully tracked object is subjected to angular projection to generate the aforementioned features. The model that was used to recognize SIBI gestures is 2-layers Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Accuracy of the proposed method is measured by comparing the prediction with the actual gesture of the testing data. The highest level of accuracy achieved for the prefix, root and suffix datasets are 91.74%, 98.94%, and 97.71% respectively. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Limitations knowledge of researcher has become an obstacle for the industry to be able to produce innovative products. Despite the fact that the government has many researchers but has not contributed optimally. For this reason, it is necessary to mobilize researcher which is one of the main problems of the low mobility into the industry, because the government has not yet provided an integrative ICT-based government service about knowledge mapping owned by institutions and individuals. Therefore, this study aims to propose a knowledge mapping system as a means of providing information that encourages the mobility of researcher in industry and SME with e-government perspective. Using qualitative methodology of CIPSODA and e-government application approach and quantitative through surveys by sampling data from three related entities (industry, government, and researchers) in Indonesia.

	<dc:abstract>One of the metacognition techniques is to provide help in solving items using help-seeking. This technique is important in improving metacognitive skills, because it contains an awareness of the need for help, monitoring knowledge and choosing a strategy to get the appropriate help and then evaluating the episode help. Metacognitive skills contain the dimension of metacognitive knowledge. Therefore help-seeking is arranged according to that dimension. However, the help-seeking series have not been able to measure whether the assistance is too excessive to meet the needs of students or even less fulfilling. This study simulates the needs of students for assistance with a help-seeking series arranged in the Markov Chain so that the assistance provided to students in a personal manner will be in accordance with the needs so that the process of finding assistance will be more efficient. The task is given to a number of students to complete the questions with hint steps in the help-seeking series. The Markov Chain are used to predict the tendency of the hint type selection to be resolved in a certain order. The results will help the education facilitator to monitor students in completing the items with the help of hints. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In spite of there are some methods for applying collaborative learning (CL) to boost participation and motivation to exchange and share knowledge, there has been no clear strategy that briefly described to support sharing processes in collaborative-based knowledge sharing tools. Thus, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify recent studies on collaborative-based systems from 2010 to 2018 by using PRISMA method. This study is objected to point out applied-specific strategic approaches in the CL environment for building an online KS tool in a concept of computer based systems. By doing a comprehensive search through Science Direct, Springer Link. And IEEE Xplore using keywords; 'knowledge sharing tools', 'collaborative learning strategy,' 'online knowledge sharing,' 'collaboration learning,' the report results from an analysis of some strategic approaches in CL environment for online knowledge sharing tools. Findings of this study offer an understanding of features, user collaboration-based technique, and technology based approach as a strategy for CL to create a knowledge sharing tool within an organization. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research was carried out to identify the influence of cultural aspects on the user experience in applying e-Learning in education. The approach applied in this study is limited to the e-Learning assessment system, which focuses on human-computer interactions but ignores the unique characteristic of the users. Culture is one of the influences that shapes the human pattern of thinking in response to action which results in a reaction. Therefore, investigating the users' characteristic requires a unification in terms of cultural factors and dimensions (aspects) which are the focus of the findings in this literature review. This paper has found 15 cultural dimensions with six of them that are cultural concepts adopted from Hofstede's theory, while the other nine are non-Hofstede or compiled theories. The other factor brought up by several researchers in the literature study is the socio-economic factor, but to be considered as a supporting factor (external factor) as it indirectly influences the user experience, and it's the limitation from this literature. In addition to the cultural aspects, the research was also able to construct a framework to measure the usability of e-Learning application based on the user experience. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The purpose of this paper is to review the use of ontology in the field of knowledge management in the academic domain. To conducting this systematic review, we used the guidelines from Kitchenham and used collected data sources from IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Emerald Insight, and ACM Digital Library. We collect paper from data sources by using boolean search through available tools in each publisher. The papers collected were only limited to the last five years and those using ontology as taxonomies. Our data search results found 346 articles, and there were 26 suitable articles selected based on the selection criteria we defined. Our findings concluded six types of ontology models contained in ontology-based knowledge management and three areas that mostly used ontology-based knowledge management systems. Finally, we also found important classes that form the basis for making an ontology used in knowledge management. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Today, the growth of data in the world is very significant, including government data. To generate value from these data, the Indonesian Government establish an Open Government Data (OGD) initiative, through Satu Data Indonesia (SDI). BPS, as an SDI coach, has an open data portal which is a guideline for other agencies in Indonesia. Therefore, assessment to BPS open data portal is important, because it will be a benchmark for the success of OGD in Indonesia. The measurement was conduct using Open Data Maturity Measurement (OD-MM), by providing questionnaires for the three SMEs at BPS, filled with interview. From the domains assessed, the result shows that the maturity level rate of BPS open data portal is at level 3 on a score from 1 to 4. This means that there are procedures and standards in implementing OGD, but their implementation is still limited to formalization of activities. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Transformation in patterns of human interaction has shifted significantly in the use of the Internet, as these trends are rapidly evolving with the advent of online means for social interaction, such as social media, social networking, messaging, and so on. The transformation happens to give us challenges and opportunities to improve the quality of knowledge management undertaken by an organization. The most critical problem that in knowledge management issue is how to identify the state, ownership, and connectedness of critical knowledge in an organization visually. The studies to overcome these problems already done with a knowledge map approach, but in practice to do knowledge mapping is still done partially, either by the manual or automatic approach. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the critical components in building integrated knowledge maps from various electronic information sources that developed in the current Internet era. Through a literary study in an article that examines the map model of knowledge and by analysing smart terminology in several contexts from several kinds of literature. This study proposes a model of smart knowledge mapping conceptual model to be an initial model in developing a knowledge map that integrates various critical components. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Implementation of e-government can improve government's services to their stakeholders. However, there are many challenges that impede its implementation. The high failure of e-government encourages the research about challenges of e-government implementation in developing countries. This study aims to identify and propose a generic framework of e-government implementation challenges in developing countries. This research used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) method and data source such as: IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and SpringerLink. From 18 sources in review, there are six challenges categories of e-government implementation in developing countries. They are IT infrastructure, managerial issue, digital culture, budgeting, laws and legislation, and human resources. Government must pay attention and focus on these challenges to ensure the successful implementation of e-government. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Due to the limitation of resources and cost, it is hard for small medium enterprises (SMEs) to survive in the competitive market, especially in establishing an effective relationship with customers. Alternatively, many SMEs use social commerce platforms to cover those limitations, one of them is Instagram-for-Business. The enterprise edition of Instagram has offered knowledge-based features to manage customer information. However, since the launching in 2016, the impact about Instagram-for-Business related to customer knowledge management (CKM) has not been researched properly. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the role of Instagram-for-Business and CKM for SME's innovation capability. By conducting a survey method, this research has collected information from 152 SMEs from any type of industry in Indonesia. The findings conclude that through CKM implementation, Instagram-for-Business significantly affects innovation capability in SMEs. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electronic Government (E-Government) was implemented to achieve the good governance. Ministry of Tourism (Kemenpar) has implemented E-Government, even though its implementation does not meet the expectation yet. Kemenpar’s performance value of PeGI (The ranking of E-Government of Indonesia) in 2014 was 2.47, it has decreased to 2.04 in 2015, and was ranked as a Low category. This declining value not only affects the governance and the quality of public service, but also shows that, there were obstacles encountered by Kemenpar to implement E-Government. The purpose of this study is to find factors which inhibited the implementation of E-Government. Quantitative approach with questionnaire and liniear regression analysis will be conducted in this study. This study found that there were only 6 out of 9 factors proven that will inhibit the implementation of E-Government in Kemenpar, i.e lacking of objectives and strategies for implementation, lacking of collaboration and coordination within Kemenpar, the technology that has not integrated, the E-Govemment service frequently unavailable and resulted to low levels of intention to use, lacking of confidence in digital information, and the failure when using the service resulted to low levels of data storage security. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Rice is one of the important commodities in Indonesia, but there are problems related to rice harvest production data and government policy. With the existence of internet network that started to enter the village, it can be utilized by the farmer or village IT team. Therefore, authors try to solve the problem by using gamification in rice information system to make data interesting and profitable for the farmer but also help the government (Bulog, Ministry of Aggriculture, and BPS) in handling farmer aid program transparency and data collection. The authors use life cycle of SSM as a method to map the problem and to choose what mechanic and element we needed to build this gamified system. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to implement gamification in rice information system, what the stakeholder task, rule, and gamified element could be used to help government for gathering data and promoting e-participation. This paper concluded that the gamification process could be used in rice information system. But for the real-life implementation, it’s still needed support from the government. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesian government institutions have become more aware of the importance of knowledge management for improving organizational performance. Development Planning Agency of Southern Sumatera Province (Bappeda Sumsel) is a government institution who implemented a Knowledge Management System called Online Disposition Website. Unfortunately, the system has not been used optimally as the rate of disposition letters produced by the system is less than one percent throughout the year 2016. In this paper, we focus on finding the affecting factors of KMS implementation in Bappeda Sumsel. A survey was spread to 123 employees in Bappeda Sumsel. The research model was adapted from six latent variables of information system success model by DeLone &amp; McLean. We empyol structural equation model to analyze survey result. We found that there is positive influence from system quality and service quality to kms use. Also, we predicate that there is positive influence from knowledge quality, service and KMS use to user satisfaction. Additionally, we found that there is positive influence from kms use dan user satisfaction to net benefit. Success model as a critical part for knowledge management system is analyzed to make sure knowledge management system is well implemented and used by the users. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Most of the e-Government projects facing problem in integration with external services, hence there is a lack of collaboration and exchange information among different public administration e-services. Directorate General of Tax (DGT) has developed many electronic services, but until today the interoperability maturity level of that services never been assessed. Interoperability Maturity Model (IMM) is a methodology to get insight and evaluate interoperability maturity of public service based on a set of defined attribute and maturity stage. We used IMM as the methodology for interoperability maturity evaluation in this research because it is the most recent, has a complete attribute for each interoperability layer, open resources and has been used in Europe's interoperability improvement program. According to the assessment, DGT's Interoperability maturity is in level 3 for overall areas. In other words, DGT electronic services are at an essential stage. The main component of interoperability best practice has implemented in DGT's electronic services. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>National development, especially in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), contributes to the economic progress of a country, not least Indonesia. But the uneven development of ICT among provinces in Indonesia has resulted in a digital divide. In order to bridge the gap, a guideline is needed to indicate which provinces need more attention in ICT development. This research aims to measure and to classify the level of the digital divide that occurred in 34 provinces of Indonesia using Digital Divide Index (DIDIX) introduced by Hüsing and Selhofer. The result indicated that there was 1 province with the low digital divide rate, 19 provinces with the medium digital divide rate, and 14 provinces with the high digital divide. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge is one of the important assets for organization. Managing knowledge properly will enable the organization to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently. Since risk of failed implementation of Knowledge Management (KM) might occur, organization needs to measure their KM Readiness beforehand to successfully implement KM. This study is intended to measure KM Readiness in government agency, namely Directorate of Bilateral Negotiations in Ministry of Trade. The research model for measuring KM readiness was developed based on previous relevant studies. KM enablers, individual acceptance, and KM SECI processes were used to develop the model and research instruments. KM Readiness in government agency was measured by accommodating factor analysis in research model. Data were collected from 53 employees as valid samples. The result shows that KM Readiness level of the Directorate of Bilateral Negotiations in Ministry of Trade is “ready but needs a few improvement”. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Employee's rotation is often performed in organization. In some periods, the rotation is performed to meet organization's requirement. However, it also indirectly leads to a decreased of organizational performance when there is a gap between job specification and the ability of employee. This problem can be handled by managing the knowledge of employees which is called knowledge management (KM). Specifically, in Indonesia, the employees who work as teachers in state high school have the high rate of employees' rotation. Therefore we need to perform KM in this condition, we must find out some factors that affecting readiness of KM implementation. The founded factors can be used to assess the readiness level of organization to implement the KM. This research proposes a method to find out factors which affecting the readiness of KM implementation in state high school of Indonesia and how importance are these factors using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The case study was take place on state senior high school in Palembang which is a capital city of South Sumatera. The result shows the affecting factors are collaboration, learning, top management support, IT Support, business strategy, ICT Use, performance expectancy of KM, effort expectancy of KM, and informal consecutively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Since the early 1990s, companies in the oil &amp; gas industry have realized that their business operations are knowledge-based, where company performance can be derived from faster identification, an assessment of an opportunity, and the speed of an exploitation. The oil &amp; gas industry is one of the leading industries in the application and development of knowledge management; this is caused by changes in market and technology from 1990s to the beginning of the 21st century. Utilizing knowledge management is a must to be able to compete with other oil and gas industry companies. Currently, Air Drilling Associates (ADA) as one of the companies in oil &amp; gas industry already has implemented knowledge management system, but its benefits are far from the expectation. In order to position their efforts and initialize knowledge management, companies need framework to use as a template. The objective of this paper is to measure the knowledge management maturity of Air Drilling Associates and other suggestion related to knowledge management for improvement. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Modern organizational resources are no longer based on economic capital, natural resources, or labor, but on knowledge as a major asset. Therefore, for an organization to have competitive advantages it is necessary to apply the concept of Knowledge Management (KM). By implementing KM in local government institutions, especially rural and island areas, it can successfully produce regional excellence by capturing, organizing, sharing and creating a new knowledge. The local governments are required to implement KM since the bureaucracy reform program was rolled out through Presidential Decree No. 81, 2010 concerning the Grand Design of Bureaucratic Reform and Ministerial Regulation on PAN and RB in 2011 concerning the application of KM in Government Organizations. In this study, the level of readiness of KM in the local government of South Halmahera is carried out using a qualitative approach. Direct interviews at the structural leadership level at the Department of Communication and Information in the District Government of South Halmahera, North Maluku were conducted, and validation tests were conducted through expert judgments (local academics) who interacted directly with a relevant government institution. The analysis results show that the level of readiness of the KM process in the Local Government of South Halmahera is 1.75 still in not ready level. The presentation of KM readiness is only 34% of the KMCSF factors from the assessment carried out, meaning that it still requires careful planning and a better strategy in the future. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Current E-Government Public Service on User Experience Perspective in Indonesia</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>E-government system is an important aspect in modern governance. E-Government system has fundamentally transformed the government service to be much faster, more reliable, and freer from bureaucratic problems which typically occur in the traditional system. To achieve this objective simultaneous and harmonious changes are required across many stakeholders and fields of studies. Lots of studies on this matter have been conducted using different kinds of perspectives, such as public administration, law, computer science, even from social science. This paper will investigate the current implementation of e-Government in Indonesia from user experience perspective. To that aim, we use desk research combined with PRISMA systematic literature review methodology and content analysis using user experience frameworks to analyze the findings. In this context, we observed studies from journal articles and conferences that describe and identify the current e-Government public service on user experience perspective in Indonesia. The result shows that pragmatic category; specifically the functionality aspect from user experience framework still constitutes a dominating research subject in e-Government studies in Indonesia.

	<dc:abstract>Call center officers need to be knowledgeable to be able to give accurate information and fast service in terms of solving customer's problems. Various knowledge in the call center needs to be processed and stored to make a call center officer's job easier. Therefore, knowledge base is needed as a knowledge storage media for the call center. Thus, this research aims to design a knowledge base model that can be used by call center officers by summarizing and combining several literature data from previous researches. Using Kitchenham's method of literature review, six publications from two search databases were chosen in relation to the topic. The result of this research is a proposed knowledge base model that can store and combine various knowledge in call centers, namely experts' knowledge, standard operational procedure (SOP) of the call center, products knowledge, training materials, frequently asked questions (FAQ) and frequently escalated questions (FEQ). By using this model, various knowledge in a call center can be stored and reused by all call center officers who have access to the knowledge base. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The benefits of using e-commerce can lead to various kinds of hedonic consumer behavior, such as e-impulse buying behavior. The importance of impulse buying can be seen from the huge sales it generates which can account from 40% to 80% of all purchases depending on product category. Therefore, with the growing of online shopping, a deeper understanding of impulse buying on Internet is becoming increasingly necessary. The purpose of this study is to examine three dimensions, i.e., individual, product attributes, and web browsing activities as antecedents of consumers impulse buying behavior. The structural equation modeling with SmartPLS 3.2 was conducted to analyze the 124 respondents. The result of this study show that key factors influencing consumers' e-impulsive buying behavior are mostly from intrinsic factors, such as their shopping enjoyment tendency, impulsive buying tendency, and their personality, especially consumers with high on extraversion and low on conscientiousness trait Product attributes unfortunately did not have significant effect on impulse buying behavior. Futhermore, from web browsing activities, this study show that hedonic web browsing have a high possibility to make a real purchase, which can lead to impulse buying. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-learning is increasingly used to support learning in various educational institutions. From the perspective of information system, e-learning is included as non-functional component of transactional processing system. However, e-learning contains a lot of knowledge that needs to be managed in order to make it into the strategic level This study aims to identify all possible knowledge contained in e-learning and analyze e-learning modules and features needed to manage the knowledge. Qualitative approach is used to perform an in-depth inductive study of the five experts9 interview results. The result shows 14 e-learning knowledge related to 5 modules. These 14 knowledge could be used as base to the development of 31 new features to be implemented in e-learning system, at the same time transform it into knowledge-based e-learning system. The number is not limited only to this result, considering there might be any other knowledge obtained from different expert perspectives. This study can be used as a reference in the development of e-learning system as well as in the more detailed future research on knowledge management adoption in e-learning. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes results from an attempt to develop a model in ontology engineering methodology and a way to validate the model. The approach to methodology in ontology engineering is from the point view of socio-technical system theory. Qualitative research synthesis is used to build the model using meta-ethnography. In order to ensure the objectivity of the measurement, inter-rater reliability method was applied using a multi-rater Fleiss Kappa. The results show the accordance of the research output with the diamond model in the socio-technical system theory by evidence of the interdependency of the four socio-technical variables namely people, technology, structure and task. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of e-government are useful to get the successful implementation of e-government services to the citizen. However, some people misunderstand about the term of CSFs because the CSFs is formed by a short word or unclearly meaning word. The purpose of this study is to describe the CSFs of e-government. Describing CSFs of e-government is very important to avoid misinterpretation of the meaning. We collected CSFs from the various literature that indexed by Scopus in the last five years with related topics. The clarification of CSFs of e-government will assist the e-government development. The approach of a method that used in this study is the systematic review using PRISMA 2009. The finding of this study is 52 the definition of CSFs of e-government and realization of stakeholders' activity as fit as the definition of CSFs of e-government. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Go-jek, as one of urban transportation modes in Indonesia, provides a variety of transportation services to customers through mobile commerce app. Because of the increasing competition with similar business models, it is important to ensure consumers reuse and reorder the services. This study aims to identify factors that affecting the continuance intention towards a mobile purchase on transportation services provided by Go-jek. The model was examined using Partial-Least Square (PLS) on SmartPLS software. The results showed that system quality, information quality, service quality and privacy and security concerns affect continuance intention towards mobile purchase through trust, flow, and satisfaction. Flow has indirectly impact on continuance intention through satisfaction. In addition, trust affects flow, which in turn affects satisfaction. Implications and suggestions are proposed to mobile commerce research according to these findings. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In e-commerce industry, providing good interaction design in organization's online systems is necessary to support organization business. This necessity triggers the ecommerce organization to conduct interaction design process. However, there is no supporting instrument to measure the maturity level of the interaction design process within the organization. This research aims to validate and finalize the proposed interaction design process maturity instrument conducted by expert judgment using Delphi method. Three experts participated in this research by giving their opinion and recommendation based on their knowledge and experiences. The proposed maturity instrument consists of two sections: assessment instrument and maturity level. The level of experts' agreement is calculated using Fleiss Kappa statistic and shown by Kappa value. The result of the expert judgement showed that the expert has 0.74 level of agreement of assessment instrument and 1 level of agreement of maturity level. This level is satisfactory. However, there still some finalization of the proposed instrument, including two indicators' deletion, three indicators' modification, and an indicator addition. There are also minor modifications for the proposed maturity level. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Agile software development, become one of the most applied methods and principles in software development industry. That methodology offers some advantages in managing time and requirements from the system user. However, it has some disadvantages in managing project resource such as codes, documentation, and knowledge which emerge in the developments process. Other weakness of agile software development was too focused on the functionality of the system. Those problems can be solved by combining it with other methods. This paper is a systematic literature review which used PRISMA as a method to gather literature regarding the improved agile methodologies from three paper databases, including Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ProQuest. As the result, we obtained 15 papers which explained the improved agile software development in all of its aspects, such as its time, documentation and usability. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As the significant success of business enterprises, information system development becomes IT managers' concern to keep the balance between business and information system. The information system has an important role to deliver advantages to the business enterprises. To keep maintain these issues, information system should be developed to innovate the business process. However, in developing an information system, the information system process improvement may obtain the possibility of information system development failures. Therefore, to avoid the failures in implementing information systems there are some important factors. Those factors are called critical success factors (CSF). Therefore, this study observes the critical success factors (CSF) in information system development (ISD) projects. This systematic literature review discusses critical success factors in information system development. The method section determines the research question. It also describes how to collect and filter the data. The order of this research written is according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Checklist or also known as PRISMA Checklist. Therefore, to collect and filter the data, this systematic literature review uses Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses method or also known as PRISMA method. There were 20 papers selected to help this research based on the filtering papers due to PRISMA flow diagram. Most of those papers are discussing information system development and the rest are about factors of information system development. The result section has two parts, which are study characteristics and study results. This systematic literature review concluded that there are five critical success factors in developing information system projects. Those critical success factors are people, project, organization, knowledge, and expertise. Those critical success factors are also supported by several items of each factor. Therefore, the output of this research is expected to satisfy the information system development projects to meet the organizations' need and reduce also possibly avoid the failures in information system development projects. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Business process model of e-Hajj in Indonesia</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Hajj is the pillars of Islam after the shahada, prayer, zakat and fasting. Hajj is an annual ritual performed by a capable Muslims (material, physical, and physiological) by visiting and praying some activities in several places in Saudi Arabia during Hajj season. For decades, there was always problems in every pilgrim seasons. To overcome the problems, the use of information system could be considered as solution, it may make the pilgrimage becomes organized and transparent since it connected to electronic systems and integrated. This system is called 'e-Hajj'. In this paper, we present the process model for e-Hajj System in Indonesia for the perspective of Government, Citizen and Business. The process model includes e-Hajj stakeholders such as e-KTP system, SISKOHAT, Immigration, Bank and Ministry's system. We use UML to depict the e-Hajj process model and develop prototype to validate the model. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Government Human Capital Knowledge Management of Republic Indonesia (NUSANTARA) is KM model that developed to solve the government human capital management problem. NUSANTARA also can enhance the bureaucratic reform program by improved the government human capital knowledge. The outcome of NUSANTARA is individual and organizational knowledge improvement which enhanced the government service performance. Implementation of NUSANTARA model can be done by assessment of each NUSANTARA layer. This research purposes to define the implementation readiness index of each ministry in order to implement NUSANTARA. Four government ministries as case study of implementation assessment, there are Ministry of Cooperatives Small and Medium Enterprises, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Law and Human Rights and Ministry of Health. Content analysis is used to define the assessment instruments. While, Pearson Correlation conducted to determine the implementation readiness of each NUSANTARA layer. Result show that four case studies ministries already implement KM. The Ministry of Cooperatives Small and Medium Enterprises and Ministry of Health implementation readiness index is eligible enough. Hence, for the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Law and Human Rights implementation readiness index is eligible. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The integration of user-centered design (UCD) and software development methodology is an interesting research field. Agile methodology, such as Scrum, is a software development methodology that is often combined with UCD. However, adding UCD into Scrum process appears to add more workload to the team. This study proposed a new method in the intention to handle workload problems: Integrating UCD with Scrumban. Scrumban emphasized the work breakdown and responsibility delegation. This method used Scrumban Board to distinguish the responsible team or personal and what to be done in the project. The role of team members same as Scrum, but in this proposed method, we add UI owner as responsible UI/UX designer. The UI Owner will evaluate the UI design to Stakeholder with Project Owner. The System will be further tested using System Usability Scale. The results of this study indicate that the integration of UCD into Scrumban as an agile methodology resulted in a more regular, managed and faster of software development process. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of non-poultry livestock with high-level consumption in Indonesia is the goat. There are two common goat diseases with similar symptoms, tetanus and botulism. However, these two diseases treatment are different, so there is a need for system which can help goat farmer to differ between botulism and tetanus disease. In the previous study, an expert system used to diagnose these diseases has been developed using one expert judgment to build diagnosis rules using certainty factors. In this study, we develop this expert system with enhancement involving five expert knowledge. This development uses brainstorming method to reconfirm the symptoms, each symptom certainty factor, and treatment recommendation. This study explores information system requirement gathering method in knowledge management domain, which is an expert system. The result of this study is a responsive web-based application for goat farmer. This system can diagnose the goat disease whether classified as tetanus or botulism, with mild, moderate, or severe level of illness along with the treatment. Therefore, goat farmers can give proper treatment without the hassle of finding a veterinarian, even further, they can prevent mortality of the goat. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Online marketplaces are rapidly growing and involving more sellers and buyers. Sellers from micro and small enterprises tend to choose online marketplaces because they do not need any effort to attract people to visit and look into their products. On the other hand, customers as buyers also prefer to use online marketplaces because it is easier for them to compare similar products among different sellers in order to get the best offers. However, in order to maintain transaction traffic and relationship between sellers and buyers, online marketplaces should pay attention to repurchase activities. The factors that influence the repurchase intention of costumers are urgently identified to make the best business strategies. This study attempts to find the factors influencing customers' repurchase intention in online marketplaces by looking from perspective of DeLone &amp; McLean IS success model and trust. To test the research model, online questionnaire were spread into buyers of online marketplace in Indonesia. As the result, the empirical findings suggest that sellers' quality and ability to provide satisfactory services positively influence customers' repeat buying objective. However, websites' quality and ability to provide satisfactory services negatively influence customers' repeat buying objective. These results imply that it is important to improve prestige of sellers participating in marketplace. Trust should be maintained because it is a strong predictor of sellers' quality and ability to provide satisfactory services that have significant impact on repurchase intention in marketplace. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The web-based information system is one of information system platform that can support any kind of its application functions using many features available. When a web application paired to the business vision, then it would go too far from decision support of the organization's management. Organizing the information is the thing to do to manage and support the decision-making. Decision making is a crucial area of management because it may define the upcoming life story of the organization. Therefore, it needs to be well constructed in a custom techniques, let say by using web-based information system development methods, by recognizing the existing studies first. The study is trying to recognize the web-based information system development and evaluation in the context of decision support by exploring the application function, techniques, subject, study's type, and decision improvement domain. The distribution of final selected studies within some databases is quite varied in number, but it shows a falling trend in the last six years. The result shows that all of the studies didn't meet the quality evaluation criteria. According to the result, the web-based information system is capable to provide decision support feature. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Both the knowledge management system (KMS) and decision support system (DSS) had a wide range research's domain. KMS in technology implementation called knowledge-based system (KBS) as a system that processing and representing the knowledge in the understandable form. When the purpose of the KBS development is a problem-solving or decision-making, then the functionality of the decision support system can be adopted. The KBS that had been developed in the context of decision support considered as knowledge-based decision support system (KBDSS). The challenge is that there no recognition towards the trend summary of the KBDSS within this past five years. In order to identify the trend of the KBDSS, this paper aimed to review the existing KBS development in the decision support context. The result of this review is the dominant research area, the common issues summary and the particular approaches as a contribution with their benefit in each selected papers. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electronic government or e-government is an information and communication technology application that aims to provide more open interaction between governments, citizens, businesses, and other non-profit organizations. In those communication processes, there are knowledge transfer or exchange processes that must be covered and managed to accomplish the goal of e-government application. Furthermore, knowledge, rapidly evolving, is increasingly recognized as a powerful strategic resource for efficiency by all types of organizations and institutions either public or private. As the proposed solution, those processes can be covered by Knowledge Management (KM) approach. This paper aims to deliver insight into key drivers, benefits, challenges, KM system types and critical success factors for KM implementation in e-government. A total of fourteen research papers have been reviewed by using systematic literature review method named Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). As the result, there are six drivers, six benefits five types of KM system, six challenges, and nine critical success factors for KM implementation in e-Government. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>To ensure Knowledge Management (KM) will be successfully implemented into organization, the capability or readiness of an organization or KM readiness must be identified at first. The studies about KM readiness in many types of organization have been done by some researchers. However, it is lack focus on government sector. This research attempted to focus on government institution to look for the differences with other types of organization. This research referred to Knowledge Management Critical Success Factor (KMCSF) and selected Underground Mine Training Center, The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia as research object. As the result, The Underground Mine Training Center still has several dimensions that have not reached 40% presentation. The dimensions are organizational initiatives to implement knowledge management (37.33%), learning (39.22%), and physical environment (17.56%). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The old paradigm assume that e-Government is simply by installing a computer makes the implementation of e-Government failure. In fact, the success of e-Government is influenced by various factors called Critical Success Factors (CSFs). This study aims to map CSFs that influenced implementation of e-Government into two term of both technology and non-technology factors. The results showed a 67 CSFs of e-Government implementation identified was successfully mapped into seven dimensions ITPOSMO (Information, Technology, Process, Objective, Staffing &amp; Skill, Management and Other Resource). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The use of E-Government in achieving good governance has been done by government to serve citizen nowadays. However, not all local government were able to implement it. PeGI that has been used as a benchmark to check government’s readiness rate in implementing E-Government can’t describe all process that need to be assessed in developing local E-Government. Moreover, the emergence of social problems, such as organizational culture and human resource management which inhibits maturation of local E-Government. Therefore, it needs one general maturity framework which capable to guide local government to develop their own EGovernment and able to address social problems that arise. This study is the incorporation of previous research results using meta-synthesis method combine with best practice, primary in COBIT 5 that has been adjusted to address a factor of social problems. The design framework begins with identifying the business principle of local government, stakeholders, concerns, requirements, and obstacles; thus, produced a model of maturity framework that has six types stages, eight types dimensions, four types main categories and 69 types sub-category of assessment processes. In the end, after the framework was tested and evaluated, we can conclude this framework already comply with PeGI’s result. From local government who had the best PeGI’s result, they had main problem in social issues and in documenting process. For local government with very low PeGI’s result, they had common constraints related to IT (low understanding of IT governance and IT management, lack of infrastructure, human resources, and understanding how to use IT Master Plan). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The proliferation and popularity of online programming forums raises the question of what affects and how do those factors affect the users' level of trust towards the knowledge that is contained within online programming forums. This study uses elements of existing studies that examine trust in online communities, using 'community dimensions' of shared consciousness, shared tradition, and obligation to society as latent variables. The indicator variables are the 'value dimensions' of social networking, community engagement, knowledge use, and impression management. The factor that affects knowledge trust the most is knowledge use, with a path coefficient of 0.57. The hypotheses regarding shared consciousness is rejected, and individual factors seem to affect knowledge use more than community factors. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to propose a generic critical success factors (CSFs) of e-Government Implementation. CSFs of e-Government implementation has been formulated by a number of researchers, but they are spread out and there is no agreement or consensus of CSFs. Many research identify some CSFs of e-Government implementation but tend to ignore some CSFs proposed by other researchers so as not to obtain generic CSFs. Therefore in this study, it was conducted a study with a particular method of qualitative meta-ethnography approach by reviewing the various studies significantly related to the CSFs of e-Government implementation from journal articles and conference and then do the synthesis process. Meta-ethnography is a technique of integrating data across studies to gain a theoretical and a new concept with a deeper level of understanding and thorough. The results showed total 67 CSFs of e-Government implementation obtained that consist of 55 CSFs measured from government perspective and 12 CSFs from public perspective. All CSFs produced can help organizations to pay attention and focus on the key area that can ensure the successful implementation of e-Government. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The commitment of National Library of Indonesia (NLI) as a Non-Ministry Government Institution (NMGI) in utilizing information technology can be seen from one of the organization's mission that is developing a diversification of library service based on ICT (Information and Communication Technology). In carrying out this mission, the entire library services implement the information technology optimally through e-Government services. To measure the implementation of e-Government at NLI, the assessment has been conducted by using Indonesia e-Government Ranking (PeGI). PeGI assessment in the National Library of Indonesia has been implemented and published in 2013 and 2014. However, in 2015 and 2016 PeGI assessment has not been implemented. Therefore, it is important to analyze and evaluate e-Government implementation in the National Library in 2016. There are five (5) dimensions to be assessed in PeGI, including policy, institutional, infrastructure, application, and planning. Data was obtained by interviews, collecting the supporting documents with a qualitative approach and descriptive data analysis. The result indicates that the e-Government implementation in NLI overall is in the good category, and there are increasement from 2013 to 2016 assessment. However, there are two (2) dimensions under the average score, i.e., policy and institutional dimensions. NLI is expected to make a better improvement and development of e-Government implementation. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-learning is a model of delivering learning content electronically with the help of computers and multimedia. ABC University has implemented the e-learning system for two (2) years in order to improve the quality of teaching and learning process. This study aims to determine the level of user acceptance, especially from the perspective of students. In other words, this study also wants to evaluate the implementation of e-learning systems in higher education as well as identifying any factors that encourage students to use e-learning system especially in ABC University. The research method used was survey with the approach of TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) as the technology acceptance evaluation model consisting of two main factors: perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The results showed perceived usefulness significantly positive influence on user acceptance, while perceived ease of use did not significantly influence on user acceptance. The perceived ease of use also significantly positive influence perceived usefulness. The variance of user acceptance could be explained by two factors about 50.5%. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Predicting future sales is intended to control the number of existing stock, so the lack or excess stock can be minimized. When the number of sales can be accurately predicted, then the fulfillment of consumer demand can be prepared in a timely and cooperation with the supplier company can be maintained properly so that the company can avoid losing sales and customers. This study aims to propose a model to predict the sales quantity (multi-products) by adopting the Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) concept and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method. The measurement of sales prediction accuracy in this study using a standard measurement of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is the most important criteria in analyzing the accuracy of the prediction. The results indicate that the average MAPE value of the model was high (3.22%), so this model can be referred to as a sales prediction model. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	<dc:abstract>Research institutions typically rely heavily on the ability and performance of researchers who may works within various disciplines. As the current researchers are aging and will retire at some point in time, the institutions must have prepared their junior researchers to continue the research work. Previous literatures have proposed and defined the concept of Knowledge Management (KM) in order to meet the goal. However, the implementation of KM in an organization is not easy. The initial step is to take measurements of the degree of readiness of the organization to implement a detailed and comprehensive KM. Thus, this study is to assess KM readiness level of BATAN, a research institution in Indonesia. The KM readiness framework was validated by 3 experts, weighted by 8 experts using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and processed using 151 respondent data. The analysis showed that KM readiness in BATAN has reached level 4 (receptive) which means BATAN is ready to implement KM. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Through a mobile application to respond citizen's grievance/complain, called QLUE, the government of Jakarta, Indonesia, begins to implement smart city concepts. However, QLUE usage and adoption level is still low compared to the number of population. Therefore, this study examined the determinants of citizen's behavioral intention to use smart city system (QLUE) based on the extended social cognitive theory (SCT) model. Data collection was conducted using questionnaire to QLUE users. The adopted model was examined using Partial-Least Square (PLS). The results showed that behavioral intention to use QLUE is positively influenced by affect and social influence. On other hand, the negative relationship between anxiety and behavioral intention is not supported in this study.

	<dc:abstract>This paper present recommendation of metadata element set for ethnophytomedicine resources from scientific journal publication to support the sharing and reuse among stakeholders. Ethnophytomedicine itself is traditional knowledge of local people about use of native medicinal plant. Development of metadata has been through utilizing four approaches, i.e. domain-Analysis, derivation analysis, system-centric analysis, user-centric analysis and resource-centric analysis. To complete domain-Analysis, we analyzed result of interview with two experts and documents that describe and review of ethnophytomedicine. In derivation analysis, the candidate elements derived from three existing related metadata standards. Moreover, to gather candidate elements in user-centric analysis, we interview the identified stakeholders of ethnophytomedicine resources. In system-centric analysis, we explored 11 systems related to ethnophytomedicine domain. The last phase, all candidate elements from derivation analysis, system-centric analysis and user-centric analysis were mapped into available information on ethnophytomedicine resources. Based on resource-centric analysis as last phase of research, we found 26 metadata elements for ethnophytomedicine resources that divided into four major sections, i.e. literature, plant, plant utilization and knowledge source. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Government Human Capital Management (GHCM) is activities to manage civil servant as government resources and assets. These assets are used as much as possible to improve the achievement of government objectives. In 2014, the government appointed legally three ministries to manage all government human capital in Indonesia. They are KEMENPAN&amp;RB, LAN, BKN and each of them has a duty respectively in GHCM. Therefore, collaboration, coordination, and teamwork are necessary to achieve the professional management of human capital among the three ministries. Knowledge management believed can enhance sharing and transferring organizational knowledge among individual and institutions in order to create new knowledge in the field of GHCM. The knowledge is essential for the completion of tasks and problems that arise in GHCM. Some continuous activities to create, manage and disseminate knowledge are known as knowledge management cycle. This research aims to determine the KM cycle of GHCM. Deep interview conducted to collect the data related to knowledge management cycle. Mixed methods used to analyze the data which sequentially done with qualitative method and then the quantitative method. Content analysis used for analyze the transcribe data and correspondence analysis is used to analyze the contingency value of each activities. Then, the findings verified by expert judgment. Result shown that knowledge management cycle of GHCM are acquire, verified, store, share and utilize knowledge wherein each stage has a different activity. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The need for software development methods that have faster and flexible development process has emerged nowadays. Agile software development method is a method that promises shorter time-to-market and higher flexibility to accommodate changes of requirements. One framework that relies on agile software development method is Scrum. It has iterative, focus on teamwork, and collaboration development process. Scrum also has several challenges, such as long users' feedback loops, lack of users' involvement in testing, and lack of software quality. In this paper, we aimed to address those challenges by applying usability testing. It is expected that by applying usability testing to Scrum could improve the Scrum in addressing the challenges. There is also a software that built using Scrum to proof the concept. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research attempted to evaluate m-government implementation based on user perspective through qualitative as well as quantitative approach named mixed method approach. After conducting literature study, we defined System Usability Scale (SUS) as quantitative approach and dimension of D&amp;M IS success model as basic for conducting qualitative approach. As case study, this paper presented the evaluation of m-Government named Qlue which is operated on mobile device to capture and response complaints from citizen in Jakarta. A total of respondent is 30 that is main user of application and worked as employee in government of Jakarta. The result of evaluation derived by analyzing feedback from questionnaire and interview to understand government employee opinion toward Qlue application implementation. Both of qualitative and quantitative results show that application had a low degree of satisfaction towards the usability and aspects to encourage user participation. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study attempted to point out the role of social capital and explicit as well as tacit knowledge sharing to build human capital of students in higher educational institution in Indonesia. The research model was adapted and inspired from Aslam et al.'s model, however, we modified knowledge sharing variable by dividing it into two types of knowledge, i.e. explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. The data collection conducted by spreading online questionnaires to students in several higher educational institutions in Indonesia. As many as 420 valid sample data was used to test hypotheses by using structural equation modeling (SEM). The result shows that the influence of component social factor between tacit knowledge sharing and explicit knowledge sharing is different. The components of social capital that influence to explicit knowledge sharing are shared language, social interaction ties, norm of reciprocity, identification and trust. However, the components of social capital that influence to explicit knowledge sharing are identification, norm of reciprocity, social interaction ties, shared language, shared vision. Moreover, tacit knowledge sharing is more influenced to human capital than explicit knowledge sharing. The result of this research can be used as basic knowledge for system developer to define features of knowledge sharing system in higher educational institution in Indonesia. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Government Human Capital Management is activities to manage government human capital based on their performance and competency. These processes were managed by three government institution (MENPAN, LAN, and BKN). These institutions should coordinate and collaborate to perform their duties and function. Knowledge management (KM) can enhance collaboration among individual and institution with sharing and transferring their organizational knowledge. KM is not easy to implement, some strategic issues, problems and challenges must be considered in KM implementation for government human capital management. This research aims to determine preliminary studies for KM implementation of government human capital management. It aims to identify strategic issue and problems in government ministries. Deep interview and observation are conducted to collect the data from three government institution. Qualitative research used to discover some findings align with respondent experiences. While, content analysis and fishbone analysis are used to analyze the data. The strategic issues are aim to developed the professional human resource and organization. While, findings problem consist of sixteen problems which represent in fishbone diagram into four categories there are people, organization, policies and technologies. Those problems cause a main effect that is unprofessional people and organization. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Public services to citizen should be improved and developed to achieve better government and satisfying citizen as its main beneficiary. The quality of public services is mainly depended on government employee or civil servant as actor who is conducted all process of services and is supported by many factors. One of significant factors which influences to employee to give better public services is ensuring welfare of civil servant. To formulate policy or regulation to support welfare of civil servant, stakeholders needed the classification of welfare status of civil servant. This research attempted to define welfare criteria and classify civil servant data based on welfare measurement by utilizing Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (k-NN). This research used qualitative approach and quantitative approach in three governmental organizations, i.e. National Civil Service Agency (BKN; Badan Kepegawaian Negara), Ministry for Administrative and Bureaucracy Reform (KemenPAN&amp;RB; Kementrian Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara dan Reformasi Birokrasi) and National Institute for Administration (LAN; Lembaga Administrasi Negara). As the result, fifteen welfare criteria of civil servant is identified, i.e. current functional position, marital status, current structural position, health allowance, functional allowance, location of office, credit score, job performance, position allowance, appreciation, structural allowance, current age, number of children, year of work, and month of work. This is also successfully classified welfare status of civil servant by using k-NN with 80.87% accuracy prediction. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Along with the development of globalization, there is a change of values and way of life in local communities. That change had an impact on the loss of potential resources of traditional knowledge. Because of the important of traditional knowledge, many people from government, non-profit organization (NGO) and others attempted to document it into digital form. However, that activity is not fully supported by communication and technology (ICT) infrastructures, e.g. mobile technology, so that process of documentation was not coordinated and integrated well. This research attempted to develop mobile application based on situation in documenting traditional knowledge in Indonesia. The mobile application development was used CommonKADS as methodology with some modifications. As the result, mobile application is successfully designed and represented into six component models, i.e. situation model, agent model, task model, knowledge model, communication model and design model. Then, all models are used as basic to deploy mobile application to meet user requirement and solve problem that has been identified and defined at beginning of research phases. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Some countries in the world have been implement e-Hajj as a part of a system that helped to organize the pilgrimage, but still no studies have discussed about the definition of e-Hajj itself. Whereas that definition affect the business process model, that runs on the organization associated with the organization of the hajj. In this paper, we discuss about a definition of e-Hajj using some literature reviews concept based on the hermeneutic approach. It used to identify many components related of hajj and e-Government to examine the question: What is the definition of e-Hajj that appropriate for Indonesia? We collect the literatures, and then make a review that related to hajj, e-Government and organization of the pilgrimage. The instances are pilgrimage activity, operational, and management to be analyzed. The purpose is to discover e-Hajj definitions that appropriate for Indonesia. This research suggests that e-Hajj is the management system of Hajj to help the candidate of Hajj from the registration until the repatriation, just using the modal data, integrated, and avail the tracking technology. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Approximately four hundred indigenous communities in Indonesia originally utilize their traditional knowledge for supporting their daily life. Because of many benefits of that knowledge, many stakeholders have started to collect and write it into a digital report. However, the digital report was still documented in the different format of metadata because there is no specific metadata schema for describing digital data of traditional knowledge. Moreover, the differences of metadata schema will make the difficult process of documenting, managing and disseminating this traditional knowledge. To overcome this problem, this work attempted to design specific metadata schema for a domain of traditional knowledge by utilizing metadata development methods, i.e., domain analysis, derivation analysis, system-centric analysis, user-centric analysis and resource-centric analysis. The selection of those methods based on literature review result toward research articles that presented about metadata development. As a result, this paper proposed metadata schema of traditional knowledge that consists of 37 metadata elements which are categorized into 6 metadata sections, i.e., supporting data, material, supporting tool, success story, knowledge source, and knowledge engineer.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Malaria is one the diseases that can cause death, especially in high-risk community groups, namely the pregnant women, infants, and toddlers. More than 310 million people worldwide are infected with malaria every year and about 2 to 3 million people died of malaria. In the area of Tanah Bumbu, the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in 2010 reported 10 deaths in 4,517 live births childbirth. In this case, it is crucial to combat Malaria at the Malaria-based region. This activity should be supported by the role of information technology. Malaria Monitoring System Electronic (e-Mamosys) is an application system developed in an effort to monitor patients with malaria. The application was tested to investigate the effects of beliefs, attitudes towards the acceptance of users. This test covers five variables, namely the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, personalization, computer self-efficacy and trust. The test was performed by 30 respondents, including the doctors, health professionals, administrative personnel, and patients. Measurement of the user acceptance of e-Mamosys was carried out using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results from the study showed personalization effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This shows that the e-Mamosys can provide the information needs of users.

	<dc:abstract>Failures in many e-Governments implementation in various countries including in Indonesia are caused by various factors. So that, it is necessary to identify the factors that can determine the level of success of e-Government in the country. This study intends to propose factors that can determine the success rate of implementation of e-Hajj in Indonesia as one of e-Government implementation. We use top-down approach to identify Critical Success Factors (CSF) as the methodology that consist of four phases. First, we use ITPOSMO to investigate the existing models. Second, we collect key success factors from literatures in preparation process. Third, we merge all of the finding key success factors by mapping them to ITPOSMO model. Fourth, in data analysis process, we analyze those factors based on their appropriate elements in IT POSMO for e-Hajj implementation CSF. As a results, we propose 82 factors as the CSF for e-Hajj implementation in Indonesia that categorized into 6 elements in ITPOSMO. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A pharmacy typically store pharmaceutical products in warehouses before being sold to the customer. Stacking of products in the warehouse can reduce the efficiency of the warehouse and increase the costs associated with inventory, which raised the problem of how to predict the stock of each product to the right in order to avoid excess/shortages. Therefore, this study aims to develop a decision support system for inventory management in pharmacy, especially to predict next inventory using FAHP and SPA approach, so the prospect of inventory management will be more optimal. The study also proposes a model to predict inventory. These results indicate that the inventory prediction accuracy using this model approach more accurate 18% than the inventory prediction accuracy by a pharmacy inventory manager, so this approach can be referred to as a decision support system. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The agricultural sector have important role for a country. The level of performance of the agricultural sector of a country depends on the quality of education in agriculture. Basically agricultural vocational education in Indonesia was established in each region in order to meet the human resources in accordance with the potential of the area. Therefore, if the agricultural lecturers that have different specialties can share the knowledge among each other it is expected that the that one lecturer can provide knowledge that is appropriate for the processing of agricultural potential in these areas eventhough it is not his speciality. So it is not depending on the specific agricultural science owned by lecturers but it depends on the potential of the area. It can be anticipated by increasing knowledge sharing among educators. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the factors that influence knowledge sharing among educators in vocational higher education of agriculture. In addition, note also whether knowledge sharing affects the performance of educators and affect the performance of the institution. This study was conducted with the literature study, interviews, and surveys. Survey data were analyzed using Partial Least Square method-Structural Equation Modeling. The results of this study indicate that knowledge sharing is one of the factors that can improve the performance of educators and can improve the performance of vocational higher education of agriculture. Knowledge sharing in this domain is strongly influenced by attitudes, personal expectations, tacit knowledge, the IT infrastructure, knowledge of the IT usage, the ability of educators, and organizational culture. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge management is a strategic issue that is usually used for strategic planning of organizational development in order to reach organization competitiveness and retaining organization knowledge. It has also become a trend in Governmental institution for implementing knowledge management align with the regulation. Internal employee rotation, promotion mutation and open bidding program among government institution take part of this loosing knowledge. Knowledge management model is set of knowledge process that encourage knowledge management initiative can enhance organizational objectives. Therefore it is needed to determine the suitable knowledge management model for the government, because the necessity of this model to accomplish some issues above. This research conducted a literature review and previous study analysis to build a theoretical model of Indonesian government knowledge management. Classification, categorization and elaboration analysis are used for construct a new theoretical model. Indonesian knowledge management model consists of two stages defining organizational strategy that delivering organizational strategy and knowledge management strategy stages which is consist of five elements, there are organization culture, critical success factor of knowledge management, SWOT analysis, organization KM process and organization knowledge map.

	<dc:abstract>Organizational culture believed as an enabler's of knowledge management implementation. Others assumed that one of critical success factor of knowledge management can be seen from its culture. Generally organizational culture has positive impact to knowledge management. Type of organizational culture can be a guide to encourage the knowledge management (KM) implementation strategy and programs. Culture can direct organization member to behave in certain manners, rules, procedures and policies as an organizational mechanism. This paper describes the process to determine the current organizational culture and suggestion future culture for implement knowledge management in government. OCAI (Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument) and its framework (Competing Value Framework) were used for identifying type of organizational culture in some government ministries/agencies which duties to manage government capital. Result of this study will be used as references for implementing knowledge management for Indonesian Government Human Capital Management for achieve their goals and competitive advantages. © 2015 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Data and information about Indonesian genetic resources and traditional knowledge, especially the current data on medicinal plants is not managed optimally yet. The data and information is still scattered which if there is no integrated management action done, the data and information might be lost. One effort to integrate the data about medicinal plants is by building the ontology. This research develops a socio-technical model in ontology engineering by taking a case study of the development of Indonesian medicinal plants ontology. The ontology will support the development of applications based on Indonesian medicinal plants. Sources of data in this ontology considered from five aspects such as pharmacology, health practitioners, plant taxonomy, plant cultivation, and conservation of rare medicinal plants. The results of this study initiate the establishment of Indonesian medicinal plants ontology that is needed by various parties and support protection and utilization of genetic resources in Indonesia optimally. Validation of the ontology is carried out through a functionality of list data of competency questions executed on a semantic web application. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research was conducted to assist the program of knowledge management (KM) implementation, which aims to improve the quality of services through bureaucratic reform. The main issue of KM implementation is critical success factors (CSF), for researches in Indonesian healthcare organization are still very limited. Therefore, it is needed to identify the components CSF of KM related to Health Information System (HIS) that was declared on Roadmap Action Plan of the Minister of Health to improve public health services through e-Health. The literatures found that are related to KM components are: people, process, technology, culture, content, etc. We focused on components: awareness and commitment, strategy, culture, people, structure, and information technology (IT) into questionnaire instruments. Subsequently, the method of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) used to list priorities, whereas each of it contains sub criteria. The outcome of components priorities will be noted as recommendation policy for government, and further referral for mental hospital in achieving the goals of KM program. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Since the presence of Inpres 3 in 2003 about policy and Development Strategy of e-Government in Indonesia, government institution should be capable to exploit potential of information and communication technology (ICT) in order to improve efficiency, transparency and accountability. In spite of the presence of regulation, Indonesia is being one of countries that the implementation of e-Government was relatively slow. According to UNDESA survey in 2012, Indonesia was left behind Vietnam and Thailand for e-Government development index [1]. In 2014, Indonesia dropped to rank 106th far below Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand in Asia region [2]. The high failure of e-Government had motivated researcher to study about success factors that influence successful e-Government implementation. In this paper, list of success factors in e-Government implementation successfully identified from the previous research [3] had been analyzed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis method was adopted to define structure validation with the sample of study consisted of 237 public employees at local government level. Result of EFA showed that four dimensions had emerged which are named as input, process, output and outcome. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) reliabiliy were 0.94 for input, 0.92 for process, 0.88 for output and 0.88 for outcome. The internal consistency reliability for whole scale was 0.97. Result of CFA showed that the model was well-fit with the empirical data since factor loading and goodness-of-fit statistical index were acceptable. Therefore, the proposed model in this research was valid and reliable toward maturity model of e-Government implementation. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Government implementation has many benefits and significant impact such as transparency, saving cost, improving productivity, quality of public services and competitive advantage in information era nowadays [1][2]. Even significant impact and benefits could be obtained but in fact, most of e-Government project was failed. Based on research survey [3], the failure was very high about 85% and project success was only 15%. Researcher had identified list of success factors to avoid failure during e-Government implementation [4], resulting 55 success factors obtained by using meta-ethnography technique would be key success factors that should be fulfilled to gain success during implementation of e-Government. In this paper, the validity and reliability was tested to ensure the importance of each success factors. Research methodology used was survey based on questionnaire to obtain data by expert judgment to rate each success factors. In order to test and analyze the value of validity and homogeneity reliability in this research used Aiken approach. The result of research showed that the content validity of each success factors had value from 0.75 to 1.0 and homogeneity reliability had value from 0.67 to 1.00. It can be said that the items were significant. Based on these result, each success factors were valid and reliable as success factors that should be accommodated to ensure successful e-Government implementation. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays organizations realize that knowledge is an important asset to achieve a competitive advantage. In the favor of that, it is necessary for organizations to manage and utilize the knowledge as much as possible through knowledge management (KM). KM concept is not only used in large companies, but also has begun to be adopted by healthcare organization in an effort to improve the quality of services. Managing knowledge is not easy, a lot of factors to consider, one of which is the culture of the organization. Organizational culture is defined as a set of practices, values, and assumptions held by members of the organization and are able to influence the behavior of the organization [12, 13]. According to Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn (2006), organizational culture can be examined using 'Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument' (OCAI) which has a framework, called the competing value framework (CVF). This framework consists of four culture types i.e. clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy. In this research, we found that healthcare organization in Indonesia have developed a dominant culture-style. It is a mix of the market and hierarchy. In addition, we also discuss the relationship of four culture types with KM, and six dimensions of organizational culture. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge management in organizations lately has become strong focus to improve enterprise's quality. Knowledge management is relatively new among practitioners and researchers on how it can be designed and implemented in organizations. Unfortunately, several past researches founded the failed implementation of knowledge management in organizations. Hence, it is essential to figure out some success factors that are appropriate to support an implementation of knowledge management. This research aims to elaborate Critical Success Factors (CSF) which influences Knowledge Management Implementation in Organization using a survey method. Afterwards, research model will be figured and all factors will be explained clearly as an outcome taken from this study. This study constructs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) model with several variables. The authors spread questionnaire to some physicians in teaching hospital at Rumah Sakit Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSCM), Jakarta. The result shows that several success factors for knowledge management implementation are education and training, human resource management, top management support, and organizational culture. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia which is the largest archipelago country in the world with complex topological conditions and has great potential of natural resources, but on the other hand susceptible to natural disasters, is requiring a comprehensive spatial management. This led to the role of Geographic Information Systems / GIS becoming very crucial in the governance of Indonesia. GIS can be a tool to maintain the integrity of the boundary, mitigate disaster, read trends, as well as support layout arrangement. Thus the demand of implementing GIS in various fields is increasing rapidly. However, implementation of GIS in Indonesia is not yet widespread. The study by Ramadhan et al (2011), from 91 E-Government systems that were examined, only 19% which were implementing GIS. One of the possible constraints might be infrastructure problems, which is low bandwidth hence resulting in high response time. This issue is potentially reducing the efficiency of GIS functionality and user interest for the use of GIS. The study proposes approaches to overcome this problem, namely Tile based GIS techniques. Tile based GIS technique increases the speed of mapping application by displaying only the relevant layer accessed from distributed spatial database. © 2012 AICIT.</dc:abstract>

The research was motivated by the many failures in implementating of KMS as well as the lack of studies on EA associated with the implementation of KMS. This study uses interpretative and socio-technical approach with soft system methodology and TOGAF as a framework. The result shows that the availability of IT infrastructure does not maximize the implementation of KMS, therefore there is a need of a new holistic EA that accommodates all of the technological and socio perspective. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We investigated how a software product line (SPL) for Web application is realized by following an established Web application development methodology called Architecture-Centric Model-Driven Web Engineering (AC-MDWE). The development process is done by using Abstract Behavioural Specification (ABS), which is an executable modelling language that provides SPL-related features. We created a case study by implementing a product line for E-commerce Web applications. The product line is realisable using ABS with modifications to the original AC-MDWE process. ABS can provide several benefits such as control during product generation, feature traceability, and preserving integrity of core assets. However, it is still not ready for creating production-level Web application and lack of readability in the generated artefacts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.</dc:abstract>

This optimization can also be applied towards Self-Organizing Maps training, particularly during finding the best matching unit in the batch training approach. This paper investigates various implementations of this optimization and measures the efficiency gained on various datasets, dimensions, maps, cluster size and density. Our experiments on synthetic and real life datasets show that the number of comparisons can be reduced to 24% and the running time can also reduced to between 63 and 87%. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Organizations need knowledge of change, such as changes in customer purchasing behaviour, to adapt business strategies in response to changing circumstances. To understand what has changed, analysts have to be able to relate new knowledge acquired from a newer dataset to that acquired from an earlier dataset. This paper presents a method to detect changes in clustering structure over time. Discovering clustering changes can also be applied in other contexts, such as fraud detection and customer attrition analysis. The key contribution of this paper is the enhancement of the measurement of relative density using SOM. This measurement is used in the visualization method called Relative Density Self-Organizing Map (ReDSOM) to compare clustering structures from two snapshot datasets. This visualization provide means for analysts to visually identify and analyze various changes in the clustering structure, such as emerging clusters, disappearing clusters, splitting clusters, and merging clusters. These contributions have been evaluated using synthetic datasets, as well as real-life datasets from the World Bank. Experiments showed that the new measure is more sensitive in detecting changes in density. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the international community. Indonesia is one of the country that quite active involved in international cooperation forums. One of the forums is South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC), a new cooperation framework in political, economic, social, cultural and technical area between at least two developing countries and one developed country. In order to support SSTC, the Government of Indonesia formed the National Coordination Team on SSTC. In its implementation, the National Coordination Team (NCT) on SSTC has not shown satisfactory results due to the lack of coordination among the Ministry involved. As a result, the programs that exist today are mostly not linked to each other, not sustainable, and not providing the maximum impact for Indonesia. To make coordination in NCT easier, we proposed to create an integrated information system that supports all of cooperation process. This research tries to design an integrated information system software that can support SSTC program in Indonesia, using RUP (Rational Unified Process) method. The results of this research will be presented as a draft of system specification, and ready to use as an initial design of the software. With the implementation of integrated information system software, we expect that all cooperation programs conducted by Indonesia can linked to each other, sustainable, and bring maximum impact for the Indonesian progress. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge of clustering changes in real-life datasets is important in many contexts, such as customer attrition analysis and fraud detection. Organizations can use such knowledge of change to adapt business strategies in response to changing circumstances. Analysts should be able to relate new knowledge acquired from a newer dataset to that acquired from an earlier dataset to understand what has changed. There are two kind of clustering changes, which are: changes in clustering structure and changes in cluster memberships. The key contribution of this paper is a novel method to automatically detect structural changes in two snapshot datasets using ReDSOM. The method identifies emerging clusters, disappearing clusters, splitting clusters, merging clusters, enlarging clusters, and shrinking clusters. Evaluation using synthetic datasets demonstrates that this method can identify automatically structural cluster changes. Moreover, the changes identified in our evaluation using real-life datasets from the World Bank can be related to actual changes. © 2014, Australian Computer Society, Inc.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Discovering cluster changes in real-life data is important in many contexts, such as fraud detection and customer attrition analysis. Organizations can use such knowledge of change to adapt business strategies in response to changing circumstances. This paper is aimed at the visual exploration of migrations of cluster entities over time using Self-Organizing Maps. The contribution is a method for analyzing and visualizing entity migration between clusters in two or more snapshot datasets. Existing research on temporal clustering primarily focuses on either time-series clustering, clustering of sequences, or data stream clustering. There is a lack of work on clustering snapshot datasets collected at different points in time. This paper explores cluster changes between such snapshot data. Besides analyzing structural cluster changes, analysts often desire deeper insight into changes at the entity level, such as identifying which attributes changed most significantly in the members of a disappearing cluster. This paper presents a method to visualize migration paths and a framework to rank attributes based on the extent of change among selected entities. The method is evaluated using synthetic and real-life datasets, including data from the World Bank. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We introduce a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based visualization method that compares cluster structures in temporal datasets using Relative Density SOM (ReDSOM) visualization. ReDSOM visualizations combined with distance matrix-based visualizations and cluster color linking, is capable of visually identifying emerging clusters, disappearing clusters, split clusters, merged clusters, enlarging clusters, contracting clusters, the shifting of cluster centroids, and changes in cluster density. As an example, when a region in a SOM becomes significantly more dense compared to an earlier SOM, and is well separated from other regions, then the new region can be said to represent a new cluster. The capabilities of ReDSOM are demonstrated using synthetic datasets, as well as real-life datasets from the World Bank and the Australian Taxation Office.

	<dc:abstract>In retail industry, it is very important to understand seasonal sales pattern, because this knowledge can assist decision makers in managing inventory and formulating marketing strategies. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is suitable for extracting and illustrating essential structures because SOM has unsupervised learning and topology preserving properties, and prominent visualization techniques. In this experiment, we propose a method for seasonal pattern analysis using Self-Organizing Map. Performance test with real-world data from stationery stores in Indonesia shows that the method is effective for seasonal pattern analysis.

	<dc:abstract>Smart tourism is a keyword for describe the tourist on emerging forms of ICT. One application of smart tourism is to classify tourist attractions automatically, where the data in the form of pictures taken by tourists. However, there are some problems in application of tourist attractions classifications. First, in one place may have different objects and traits. Second, in some places may have a similar architecture, so it could be difficult for the system to classify the places. In this study, we focused on the tourist attractions in Jakarta and Depok using ResNet50. We divided this study into 2 scenarios. Scenario 1 is a model with 12 classes, and scenario 2 is a model with 16 classes. The results are ResNet50 has been able to handle both research problems, although not yet maximized, with average accuracy in scenario 1 is 92.17% and scenario 2 is 93.75%. © 2019 IEEE.

In this research, we developed a smart system for Betawi culinary tourism. Detection of traditional food names using images is a challenge because the variety of shape and direction of shooting is always different. The use of deep learning architecture is expected to overcome the problem, but the selection of effective deep learning architecture is also a problem. This study compares some deep learning architecture to determine the suitable architecture to detect culinary images. Based on our experimental results, DenseNet169 gives the best performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and training time when using CPU and ResNet50 when using GPU.. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Deep learning is a part of machine learning area that has proven to solve many problems in the real world such as object recognition and detection. One of popular deep learning methods is Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). Faster R-CNN proposed an integrated structure of CNN and region proposal network to detect multiple objects in a single image. Even though deep learning is powerful for object recognition or detection, it would still be a problem for implementing both the learning and the inference on mobile devices due to the need for a large memory and computation. In this paper, we propose to reduce the number of fliters and nodes in the convolutional and fully connected layer to 50% to make it feasible for implementation in a mobile environment and compared it with the original model. Second, we use Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) in the convolutional layer to regularize Deep Neural Network (DNN) structure with group lasso. Third, we use Ristretto framework to convert floating point to 8 and 16 bits fixed point to represent weights and outputs of the fully connected layer. Our result shows that filter and node number reduction lowering memory storage down to 4.16x and successfully trained on NVIDIA Jetson Tegra TX1 Development Kit as mobile environment emulator. Ristretto successfully condense a model to 16 or 8 bits with error tolerance ∼1% but has better accuracy from 0.85 to 0.87 at k = 5 for the original model, and 0.84 to 0.85 at k = 10 for 50% model on CCTV UT dataset. SSL works well on 50% model that obtain better accuracy from 0.83 to 0.84 in k=5 and from 0.84 to 0.86 in k=10 and accelerates computation time 2.72x faster than the original convolution layer without SSL. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Sentiment analysis is one of the topics that recently getting more popular on political field or government-related things. Analyzing citizens' view of the government, including Governor and Vice Governor of DKI Jakarta for 2017-2022 period, is one of tasks that can be done using sentiment analysis. Data related to that topic ar e gathered from Twitter and Instagram for further analysis. N-gram, emoji, and all-caps is used as features to classify sentiment of each item. Based on the experiment, those features can help to increase classification performance. Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM algorithm are compared to select the best algorithm out of those three algorithms. Based on the experiment, SVM get the best result with highest accuracy and F1-score on both domains. The result of the classification shows that citizens tend to have neutral view on Governor and Vice Governor of DKI Jakarta for 2017-2022 period on their first year of governance. In addition, there are more positives than negatives on citizens' view. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

We propose a new approach for Javanese character segmentation, i.e. a machine learning based method using CRF and SVM with a set feature of Javanese character's categorization and its combination with dictionary-based method. Through several experiments, it is proven that combination of dictionary-based method and CRF performs best than word segmentation using CRF, SVM, and traditional dictionary-based word segmentation. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Actualizes the progressiveness of digital business, gig economy brings easiness for people to search and do project using platforms. This opportunity may affect many treats, such as inefficient business processes and lack of professionalism. Many operators of gig platform govern their business processes intuitively without clear method or roadmap so that their growth is not predictable. This study proposes maturity model for gig economy business process to standardize growth of gig economy by considering the differentiating factors. It encompasses five levels: Initial, Defined, Standardized, Measured, and Optimized. They are appraised using eight staged Business Process Areas, related Specific Goals, and detail Specific Practices. This model relies on the evidence as Work Product to decide the compliance on each level. This maturity model is developed through five phases with hierarchy from CMMI-Service. It produces guidance to evaluate current reflection and formulate necessary improvement towards mature and qualified business processes in gig economy. Therefore, gig economy can generate more benefits and contributions for society. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are organizations that have a tendency to focus only on their business process because they have limitation in terms of resource, both human and financial. E-business is the recommended solution for SMEs to support their business process. E-Business system is a suggested solution for SMEs to support their business processes, where SMEs can use applications in accordance with their organizational characteristics. This system can support business growth in SMEs. But SMEs have very diverse characteristics, based on size, industry sectors, tendency to adopt IT, etc. E-Business solution for SMEs is not a one-size-fits-all solution but need to pay attention to the characteristics of SMEs as the end-users. By adopting the Design Science Research Methodology, this paper proposes an architecture for integrated e-Business System that can be implemented based on the characteristics of SMEs. So that it is expected, SMEs can get e-Business solutions that are in accordance with their characteristics. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An ontology-based system can currently logically reason through the Web Ontology Language Description Logic (OWL DL). To perform probabilistic reasoning, the system must use a separate knowledge base, separate processing, or third-party applications. Previous studies mainly focus on how to represent probabilistic information in ontologies and perform reasoning through them. These approaches are not suitable for systems that already have running ontologies and Bayesian network (BN) knowledge bases because users must rewrite the probabilistic information contained in a BN into an ontology. We present a framework called ByNowLife, which is a novel approach for integrating BN with OWL by providing an interface for retrieving probabilistic information through SPARQL queries. ByNowLife catalyzes the integration process by transforming logical information contained in an ontology into a BN and probabilistic information contained in a BN into an ontology. This produces a system with a complete knowledge base. Using ByNowLife, a system that already has separate ontologies and BN knowledge bases can integrate them into a single knowledge base and perform both logical and probabilistic reasoning through it. The integration not only facilitates the unity of reasoning but also has several other advantages, such as ontology enrichment and BN structural adjustment through structural and parameter learning. © 2019 by the authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Reverse engineering is the information extraction process on system by identifying and analyzing the components that are part of that system. We analyze existing research that related with reverse engineering process on software product line. There are two product line processes according to Software product line engineering framework they are domain engineering process and application engineering process. We investigate reverse engineering in domain engineering process (domain requirements, domain design, and domain realization, domain quality assurance). We performed a systematic literature review. A manual search resulting 71 papers considered for analysis. Results: The majority of reverse engineering studied in three domain activity in domain engineering process. That is requirement engineering, domain design and domain realization. There are inconsistent correlations between features in the reverse engineering process. These approaches extract features without constraints between its features. Conclusions: Reverse engineering methods are needed that are able to identify and maintain a consistent correlation between features in application engineering and domain engineering in the reverse engineering process. Finally, we provide gaps from existing research and show opportunities for future research. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

Tight relationship between functional and non-functional will determine the quality of requirements, in which ultimately determines the quality of the software being built. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) often get less attention in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. In NFR determination, it is necessary to know the attributes and determination criteria that will make easier to determine the relation to FR (Functional Requirements) related. Nowadays many software developers use the Agile Methodology, where the determination of NFR by means of interviews with its stakeholders. Considering the importance of NFR attributes, then the NFR attributes mapping, how to obtain NFR attributes, and how to represent them closely with FR. The research method uses the Prisma Framework. The results of this research determine the NFR attributes domains, identification of NFR attributes, classification of NFR attributes, NFR representation between FR and NFR attributes, are used to obtain application features. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Reasoning in ontology is currently limited to logical reasoning. It is because ontology does not have a standard for probabilistic reasoning. Various approaches have been made by researchers to add the ability for ontological reasoner to do probabilistic reasoning. The approach is done by combining ontology with Bayesian network that does have probabilistic reasoning abilities. This study mapped out various approaches performed in combining ontologies with Bayesian networks to realize logical and probabilistic reasoning simultaneously. We use a systematic literature review method to identify the primary studies on combining ontology with Bayesian network following a predefined review protocol. We searched from four indexing services (SCOPUS, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SpringerLink) and got the result of 74 papers accepted for the review. We extracted properties from these studies and found 8 motivations of the studies, 5 contexts, 4 factors involved, and 5 techniques used in combining ontology with Bayesian network. The aim and the context are clearly stated in most of the studies, while most of the authors did not completely discuss the threats in their papers. As for the method and findings, most of the studies describe and discuss it moderately. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.</dc:abstract>

This research proposes a conceptual framework in software maintenance by utilizing knowledge management process and software comprehension using ontology as formal modeling analysis to expliciting the tacit knowledge in software. The topic of software comprehension is an important part for software engineer's effort. This framework is realized by means the Requirements Recovery and Reconstruction (R3) method based Software Tools (R3ST) environment.

	<dc:abstract>Precise CRM implementation for companies certainly affects the business survival of a company because it will relate to the maintenance of good and right relationship with the customers which will make their loyalty improves. There are numerous models/frameworks of CRM which is widely known today. By making comparison between these models, we can make exact and useful deliverables to identify crucial points in building Social CRM model/framework. To harmonize business with the Information Technology, we need to create enterprise architecture that suit the company's situation. The merger of Zachman framework and Architecture for Integrated Information System (ARIS) is viewed as the bridging of Social CRM model/framework with its technology development and information system which will bring success in the implementation process. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2014.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Today's, CRM implementation has become important, especially for matured company. It is because customer loyalty is very important for business continuity. However, many CRM implementations do not give a significant result to the organization, although the investment is not small. Evaluation is needed to make sure that implementation align to business strategy. Evaluation model can be different for each organization. This research develops an effectiveness CRM evaluation model in which suitable to the research object. Evaluation model will be created using Balanced Scorecard perspective. Based on organization characteristics, IT BSC is modified to become Business-Centric BSC. After define goals and measurement for each perspective, model testing is performed to related organization. The outcome of this research is CRM effectiveness evaluation model that is suitable for research object. After performed evaluation, it is expected that organization knows better, which part that must be fixed to increase effectivity of CRM implementation. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Customer Relationship Management in this social media era (which is known as Social CRM or CRM 2.0) requires a quite different treatment compared to the previous one (or often referred to as Traditional CRM or CRM 1.0). The use of social media in the Social CRM has changed the role of the company and the customer, which was originally a corporate centric to currently a customer centric. Universities and colleges are a different service company compared to other kind of service companies in general term. Social CRM Framework is needed in this higher education sector because their customers (students) are very expertise in the use of technology. It makes this generation very familiar in utilizing social media. This Social CRM Framework is built on the Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework, results an information system outcome since Enterprise Architecture 672 Meyliana and Eko K. Budiardjo can bridge the speed gap between business changes with the information technology change. The EA used is the Zachman Framework and Architecture of Integrated Information System (ARIS) Framework. The mapping results between Social CRM Frameworks and EA has produces 6 cells, namely the data, time, network, people, function and motivation. This paper discuss how to fill in the function cell and people cell using the Value Chain Process (is called the Higher Education Value Chain) and the APQC Process Classification FrameworkSM approach which is made into business process outcome, then this business process will be described to be business process model and workflow model (organization unit and work product). © 2014 Meyliana and Eko K.

	<dc:abstract>An existing application software perhaps has no requirements document or requirements document does not represent the application. The situation creates a problem in application software maintenance or reengineering. Thus, requirements document should be reconstructed from the existing application software. Effort on reconstructing a requirements document from the existing application software is similar to requirements document construction for a new application software, needs requirements elicitation. Requirements elicitation can be done using an ontology model that captures end-to-end interaction between users and system. Using the ontology model does not need software documentation and source code at all, the only one is the existing application software itself. In this case, the existing application software should be executed and then observed its behavior in term of end-to-end interaction on each starting point in which the interface identified. This set of interaction flows is known as a Use Case Realization (UCR) in Requirements Management with Use Case (RMUC) approach. The appropriate ontology model provides an ease to understand the software requirements semantic meaning. The model consists of two models includes, WIMP-UI (Window Icon Menu Pointer - User Interface) and USI (User - Interaction) ontology models. © 2013 SERSC.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Adoption and implementation of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is not merely a technological installation, but the emphasis is more on the application of customer-centric philosophy and culture as a whole. CRM must begin at the level of business strategy, the only level that thorough organizational changes are possible to be done. Changes agenda can be directed to each departmental plans, and supported by information technology. Work processes related to CRM concept include marketing, sales, and services. FrontCRM is developed as framework to guide in identifying business processes related to CRM in which based on the concept of strategic planning approach. This leads to processes and practices identification in every process area related to marketing, sales, and services. The Ontology model presented on this paper by means serves as tools to avoid framework misunderstanding, to define practices systematically within process area and to find CRM software features related to those practices. © 2013 SPIE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Handling a conflict (inconsistency) is one of active areas in the research of Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE). In the modeling of GORE, the conflict may occur in the operation model, but basically is will take root from goal model. Therefore, the conflict handling in the GORE must be carried out in the goal model. Ontology is used to capture the knowledge of certain domain wished. One of language standards for ontology that has been widely used is Ontology Web Language (OWL) from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One of the features of Ontology described using OWL is that it can be processed using a reasoner, where one of reasoner's standard service is the checking of consistency. This paper presents how the Ontology OWL is used for the consistency checking in the goal model. The first step conducted is to convert the goal model into Ontology using Protégé. Parallel with the first step, Ontology (Protégé) equipped with certain reasoner carried out the checking consistency of terminology, designation, and structure. The next step is to conduct the checking of logic consistency (Strong conflict and/or Weak conflict) by defining the rules using SWRLTab. © 2012 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A dynamic environment can radically change the improvement of software for information system development. The change related to the time, cost, effort and quality. This situation forces the system to improve its reusability in terms of commonality and variability business processes. In order to response to it, we develop mechanism for system architecture that based on technical and business process alignment approach. We proposed system architecture that characterizes by business process commonality and variability. The proposed system architecture consists of busines process layer, user interface layer, application layer, integration layer, legacy business process layer and data layer. Variant of business processes and tasks can be embedded to one another. Beside that, it can support substitution and replacement among part of business processes and tasks that make possible for sharing parts among entitites. The entitiy can choose suitable parts of common and specific business processes in dynamic environment. Hence, the system architecture can minimize time, cost, effort and improve software quality for information system. © 2012 AICIT.</dc:abstract>

The use of a Custodial Application (CA), generated solely from a data model and relation definition, is introduced in this research work. A Custodial Application (CA) is an application for creating, maintaining, and querying the enterprise information which is modeled in the EER diagrams using a CASE Tool. The CA is intended as (a) a facility for discussions between the software developer and the users in order to get user feedback for the applications that they develop; (b) a facility for verifying whether the data model has represented the enterprise information or not; (c) a starting point for the coding phase; (d) a final product if the user accepts the limitations of the custodial application.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Sign language is a language that uses a combination of hand gestures and lip movements for people with hearing impairment to communicate. In Indonesia there are two sign language systems used, Sign System for Indonesian Language known as SIBI (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia) recognizes as the official sign language system by the Indonesian Government. This research is focused on the generation process of skeleton sequence; in which represent a SIBI hand gesture excluding the finger joints. The hand skeleton that will be generated from the generation process is limited to root-word gestures only. Some researchers were using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine model and its variant known as Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to solve the sequence modelling problems. One of DBN variants is Sigmoid Belief Network (SBN). An SBN is a Bayesian network that models a binary visible vector. Deep Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (DTSBN) is a sequence of SBNs (with deep architecture) arranged in such way that at any given time step has a fully generative process capability, where data are readily generated from the model using ancestral sampling. Since, DTSBN performance is quite novel for this particular case, we decided to implement the DTSBN model using the SIBI dataset from the previous research to construct generated hand-skeleton gestures which represent SIBI’s root-word gestures. Based on the success of the experimental DTSBN model that has been successfully generated new skeleton sequences, which represent a SIBI hand gesture. Some of the inputs to the model include cartesian coordinates from shoulder joints, elbow joints, and wrist joints and the newly generated data are proven have no significant difference with the actual data set. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>SIBI is used formally as a Sign Langnage System for Bahasa Indonesia. SIBI follows Bahasa Indonesia's grammatical structure, which makes it a unique and complex Sign Language System. The state of current research in SIBI is that it is possible to translate the alphabet, root words and numbers to text. This research focuses in recognizing inflectional words, which are root words and combination of prefix, infix and suffix. By separating the root words, prefix, infix and suffix, it was possible to use minimal feature sets. SIBI sequence data contains temporal dependencies, therefore Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is chosen as the machine learning model to use on this problem. The entire sequence of feature sets based on the SIBI inflectional word gestures is used as input TensorFlow is used as development framework to make sure model can be easily deployed to a variety of devices, including smartphone». The best results were obtained using a 2-layer LSTM with 96.15% of accuracy for root words. The same model obtained an accuracy score of 78-38% with Inflectional words. The model, however, still struggles in recognizing prefixes and suffixes correctly. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>SIBI (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia) is the commonly used sign language in Indonesia. SIBI, which follows Indonesian language's grammatical structure, is a complex and unique sign language. A method to recognize SIBI gestures in a rapid, precise and efficient manner needs to be developed for the SIBI machine translation system. Feature extraction method with space-efficient feature set and at the same time retained its capability to recognize different types of SIBI gestures is the ultimate goal. There are four types of SIBI gestures: root, affix, inflectional and function word gestures. This paper proposed to use heuristic Hidden Markov Model and a feature extraction system to separate inflectional gesture into its constituents, prefix, suffix and root. The separation reduces the amount of feature sets that would otherwise as big as the product of the prefixes, suffixes and root words feature sets of the inflectional word gestures. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Sign System for Indonesian Language (SIBI) is a rather complex sign language. It has four components that distinguish the meaning of the sign language and it follows the syntax and the grammar of the Indonesian language. This paper proposes a model for recognizing the SIBI words by using Microsoft Kinect as the input sensor. This model is a part of automatic translation from SIBI to text. The features for each word are extracted from skeleton and color-depth data produced by Kinect. Skeleton data features indicate the angle between human joints and Cartesian axes. Color images are transformed to gray-scale and their features are extracted by using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with Cross Correlation (CC) operation. The image's depth features are extracted by running MATLAB regionprops function to get its region properties. The Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) and Random Forest (RF) training algorithm from WEKA data mining tools are used as the classifier of the model. Several experiments with different scenarios have shown that the highest accuracy (96,67%) is obtained by using 30 frames for skeleton combined with 20 frames for region properties image classified by Random Forest. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper shows the first part of the automatic Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) into text translation system. The focus of this project is on translation of the alphabet (A to Z) and numbers 1 to 10. Using a combination of a Kinect camera, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Cross Correlation Function and classifying algorithm Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) can create a simple system to recognize alphabet A to Z and number 1 to 10 in Indonesian Sign Language. The skeleton extraction function and depth sensor from the Kinect camera are used to capture and transfer of hand gesture movements into frames of images. DCT is used to transform spatial data of each frame of image into its spectral domain. Collection of Cross Correlation values between same rows or columns of data from two consecutive frames can be used as a signature of a character. Each signature is unique and needs a small amount of data. GLVQ is used as the classifying algorithm to recognize the character. From our experiments, the system we proposed has obtained a high degree of accuracy in the recognition of alphabet and numbers in Indonesian Sign Language. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Evidence derived from passages that closely represent likely answers to a posed query can be useful input to the ranking process. Based on a novel use of Community Question Answering data, we present an approach for the creation of such passages. A general framework for extracting answer passages and estimating their quality is proposed, and this evidence is integrated into ranking models. Our experiments on two web collections show that such quality estimates from answer passages provide a strong indication of document relevance and compare favorably to previous passage-based methods. Combining such evidence can significantly improve over a set of state-of-the-art ranking models, including Quality-Biased Ranking, External Expansion, and a combination of both. A final ranking model that incorporates all quality estimates achieves further improvements on both collections. © 2018 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We formulate a document summarization method to extract passage-level answers for non-factoid queries, referred to as answer-biased summaries. We propose to use external information from related Community Question Answering (CQA) content to better identify answer bearing sentences. Three optimization-based methods are proposed: (i) query-biased, (ii) CQA-answer-biased, and (iii) expanded-query-biased, where expansion terms were derived from related CQA content. A learning-to-rank-based method is also proposed that incorporates a feature extracted from related CQA content. Our results show that even if a CQA answer does not contain a perfect answer to a query, their content can be exploited to improve the extraction of answer-biased summaries from other corpora. The quality of CQA content is found to impact on the accuracy of optimization-based summaries, though medium quality answers enable the system to achieve a comparable (and in some cases superior) accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques. The learning-to-rank-based summaries, on the other hand, are not significantly influenced by CQA quality. We provide a recommendation of the best use of our proposed approaches in regard to the availability of different quality levels of related CQA content. As a further investigation, the reliability of our approaches was tested on another publicly available dataset. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We examined whether the microblog comments given by people after reading a web document could be exploited to improve the accuracy of a web document summarization system. We examined the effect of social information (i.e., tweets) on the accuracy of the generated summaries by comparing the user preference for TBS (tweet-biased summary) with GS (generic summary). The result of crowdsourcing-based evaluation shows that the user preference for TBS was significantly higher than GS. We also took random samples of the documents to see the performance of summaries in a traditional evaluation using ROUGE, which, in general, TBS was also shown to be better than GS. We further analyzed the influence of the number of tweets pointed to a web document on summarization accuracy, finding a positive moderate correlation between the number of tweets pointed to a web document and the performance of generated TBS as measured by user preference. The results show that incorporating social information into the summary generation process can improve the accuracy of summary. The reason for people choosing one summary over another in a crowdsourcing-based evaluation is also presented in this article. © 2015 ASIS&amp;T.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>National Cyber Security (NCS) is multi-disciplinary in nature and diverse in practice. This diversity leads to difficulty in developing a framework, because it consists of variety of components. This research addresses the implementation of the Grounded Theory approach in order to analyze components of national cyber security framework. The primary data collection comes from focus group discussion (FGD) that involve 6 (six) experts in the area of NCS. Transcripts of FGD are analyzed and coded. Preliminary data are discussed and confirmed. From the data and transcripts analyses, it is identified that the NCS constitutes twelve components. These components will be used in the future research, to construct initial Indonesian's NCS Framework. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Utilization of Information and Communication Technology in government sector or E-Government has become an important part. Almost all activities and process in government are/have been supported by Information and Communication Technology. In fact, E-Government not only contributes positively, but also generates threats to the country if not properly managed. The government agency needs control of security to protect their critical asset and information, but controls of security for E-Government sometimes require high cost or obstruct productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to find out how to protect E-Government with proportional level of protection or balanced. This paper is a conceptual research about E-Government security framework. This framework consists of multi-layer components. The main aim of this framework is to ensure that all E-Government services and process are secured with proportional level of protection. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Data quality is a major issue in the devel- opment of knowledge graphs. Data completeness is a key factor in data quality pertaining to how broad and deep is information contained in knowledge graphs. As for large- scale knowledge graphs (e.g., DBpedia, Wikidata), it is conceivable that given the vast amount of information contained in there, they may be complete for a wide range of topics, such as children of Joko Widodo, cantons of Switzerland, and presidents of Indonesia. Previous research has shown how one can augment knowledge graphs with statements about their completeness, stating which parts of data are complete. Such meta-information can be leveraged to check query completeness, that is, whether the answer returned by a query is complete. Yet, it is still unclear how such a check can be done in practice, especially when many completeness statements are involved. We devise implementation techniques to make completeness reasoning in the presence of large sets of completeness statements feasible, and experimentally evaluate their effectiveness in realistic settings based on the characteristics of real-world knowledge graphs. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Semantic Web is commonly interpreted under the open-world assumption, meaning that information available (e.g., in a data source) captures only a subset of the reality. Therefore, there is no certainty about whether the available information provides a complete representation of the reality. The broad aim of this article is to contribute a formal study of how to describe the completeness of parts of the Semantic Web stored in RDF data sources. We introduce a theoretical framework allowing augmentation of RDF data sources with statements, also expressed in RDF, about their completeness. One immediate benefit of this framework is that now query answers can be complemented with information about their completeness. We study the impact of completeness statements on the complexity of query answering by considering different fragments of the SPARQL language, including the RDFS entailment regime, and the federated scenario. We implement an efficient method for reasoning about query completeness and provide an experimental evaluation in the presence of large sets of completeness statements. © 2018 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information extraction traditionally focuses on extracting relations between identifiable entities, such as &lt;Monterey, locatedIn, California&gt;. Yet, texts often also contain Counting information, stating that a subject is in a specific relation with a number of objects, without mentioning the objects themselves, for example, “California is divided into 58 counties”. Such counting quantifiers can help in a variety of tasks such as query answering or knowledge base curation, but are neglected by prior work. This paper develops the first full-fledged system for extracting counting information from text, called CINEX. We employ distant supervision using fact counts from a knowledge base as training seeds, and develop novel techniques for dealing with several challenges: (i) non-maximal training seeds due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases, (ii) sparse and skewed observations in text sources, and (iii) high diversity of linguistic patterns. Experiments with five human-evaluated relations show that CINEX can achieve 60% average precision for extracting counting information. In a large-scale experiment, we demonstrate the potential for knowledge base enrichment by applying CINEX to 2,474 frequent relations in Wikidata. CINEX can assert the existence of 2.5M facts for 110 distinct relations, which is 28% more than the existing Wikidata facts for these relations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information extraction (IE) from text has largely focused on relations between individual entities, such as who has won which award. However, some facts are never fully mentioned, and no IE method has perfect recall. Thus, it is beneficial to also tap contents about the cardinalities of these relations, for example, how many awards someone has won. We introduce this novel problem of extracting cardinalities and discuss specific challenges that set it apart from standard IE. We present a distant supervision method using conditional random fields. A preliminary evaluation results in precision between 3% and 55%, depending on the difficulty of relations. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Wikidata is a fast-growing, crowdsourced, and entity-centric KB that currently stores over 100 million facts about more than 21 million entities. Such a vast amount of data gives rise to the question: How complete is information in Wikidata? It turns out that there is no easy answer since Wikidata currently lacks a means to describe the completeness of its stored information, as in, Which entities are complete for which properties? In this paper, we discuss how to manage and consume meta-information about completeness for Wikidata. Due to the crowdsourced and entity-centric nature of Wikidata, we argue that such meta-information should be simple, yet still provide potential benefits in data consumption. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via COOL-WD (http://cool-wd.inf.unibz.it/), a completeness tool for Wikidata, which at the moment collects around 10,000 real completeness statements. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

	<dc:title>Enabling fine-grained RDF data completeness assessment</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, more and more RDF data is becoming available on the Semantic Web. While the Semantic Web is generally incomplete by nature, on certain topics, it already contains complete information and thus, queries may return all answers that exist in reality. In this paper we develop a technique to check query completeness based on RDF data annotated with completeness information, taking into account data-specific inferences that lead to an inference problem which is ΠP 2 -complete. We then identify a practically relevant fragment of completeness information, suitable for crowdsourced, entity-centric RDF data sources such as Wikidata, for which we develop an indexing technique that allows to scale completeness reasoning to Wikidata-scale data sources.We verify the applicability of our framework using Wikidata and develop COOL-WD, a completeness tool for Wikidata, used to annotate Wikidata with completeness statements and reason about the completeness of query answers over Wikidata.

We present a technique to express such information in RDF and incorporate it into SPARQL query answering.

	<dc:abstract>Although most research communities actively disseminate information about their projects, publications, and members, there is no well-established standard for doing so, and thus the value of this data is reduced, e.g. in terms of accessibility, discoverability, and reusability. Linked Data is a method of publishing and linking structured data on the Web using RDF (Resource Description Framework). We propose LinkedLab: a Linked Data based solution for data management regarding research communities. The use of Linked Data affords a more effective way to access, organize, and integrate this data. LinkedLab is organized into three major parts: the LinkedLab ontology, the LinkedLab nodes, and the LinkedLab integrator. The ontology presents a unified view of structured data stored across multiple LinkedLab nodes, enabling data integration by the integrator. The combination of these parts provides all necessary requirements to maximizing the potential benefits of Linked Data in the research environment. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to determine what factors that motivate users to use the hashtag and geotag features on Instagram while traveling. It also seeks to determine the relationship between using Instagram features, traveling experience, expectation, confirmation, and satisfaction on traveling journeys. This study collected data from 606 Indonesian travelers. Then, the data analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that the use of hashtags and geotags during traveling improve their satisfaction. Additionally, information seeking, chronicling, and etiquette are found to be influencing hashtag use. Meanwhile, geotag use are influenced by geotag enjoyment and anticipated rewards. © 2019, © 2019 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper tries to identify and resolve ERP related problems at PT Mega Eltra, an Indonesian Small Medium Enterprise. Although PT Mega Eltra has implemented SAP ERP system for 3 years, several expectations are not met because the best practice implementation is not fulfilled. Thus, we apply soft system methodology to find the root cause of the current issues. We obtained data using interview to six employees. Then, we compare the best practice to the reality and identify the gap between them. Results show that PT Mega Eltra have problems in several aspects, namely project management, business process reengineering, vendor, strategy, training, and communication. We recommend several things to improve the business performance, such as upgrading server, automating third-party applications for approval, implementing customer relationship management and supply chain management systems, integrating HCM applications, implementing dashboard, and implementing knowledge management. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Over several decades, Indonesia's labor participation is vastly dominated by males. The problem lies on the women's limited opportunities to access and control the resources, combines with their low skills, lack of education, and ideological barriers that land the women in the 'stay in the kitchen' mentality. This also affects economic fields, including digital business fields such as e-commerce. Due to this reason, female empowerment in Indonesia is extremely needed. This paper focuses on a case study of a fintech service in Indonesia called Amartha.com. Amartha is a peer-to-peer lending service that also contributes to the women empowerment. The research is conducted by performing interviews involving Amartha.com's lenders and borrowers as well as literature study. The authors found that Amartha has succeeded in increasing women's income, creating new jobs, improving community planning and organizational experience, and building skills. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia consumers are showing increasing interest in health portal and application, due to rising health awareness and internet adoption. By utilizing health portal and application, people can reduce the number of visits to offline health facilities, thus, saving time and money. Although it has many benefits, the level of adoption of health applications and portals in Indonesia is relatively low. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study of Alodokter, a digital platform providing healthcare information and services in Indonesia. Using the customer reviews in Alodokter apps and Google play, we examine factors that become the concern of customers when using Alodokter. Our findings show that there are factors influencing customers' attitude toward Alodokter: (1) ease of use, (2) usefulness, (3) trust, and (4) doctors and another contributors' attitude. Our approach confirms and proposes actionable prescriptions for a healthcare mobile application. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Branchless banking app is considered new technology in Indonesia. Thus, the initial trust is among the critical factors that may influence people to adopt branchless banking app. Many people feel that making transaction in branchless banking app is risky and unsafe. Therefore, the number of active users in the app still below target in its first year. This study examines the factors that affecting users' initial trust towards branchless baking apps. Using Jenius, the first branchless banking app in Indonesia, this study combines several IT adoption theories such as Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Initial trust building theory. Survey was conducted to obtain data and PLS-SEM is utilized to test the overall correlation pattern between the proposed construction variables. It is found that information quality, customer support quality, and bank reputation are among factors that influence users' initial trust. Meanwhile, users' initial trust affects their perception towards easiness, usefulness and intention to use branchless banking app. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study identifies the factors that influence the continuance usage of mobile wallets and examines continuance usage of mobile wallets that have been registered with Bank Indonesia and issued by non-banks. The respondents were the Indonesian population that have used one of the mobile wallets, such as DOKU, Dompetku, Telkomsel Wallet (T-Cash), UNIK, GO-PAY, XL Tunal, or TrueMoney. The data were then analyzed with a structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the data processing show that the factors influencing continuance usage of mobile wallets are trust, flow, and satisfaction. Furthermore, quality factors consist of system quality, service quality, and information quality, which affect trust and flow directly. Satisfaction is directly influenced by trust and indirectly by the previously mentioned quality factors. Thus, mobile wallet service providers must continue to improve the system quality, service quality, and information quality of their m-wallet applications. The trust factor also influences flow and satisfaction; thus, directly improving the quality can improve the user experience and user satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Lack of trust has been repeatedly identified as a major barrier to the adoption of online shopping. However, there has been little investigation of the estblishment of interpersonal trust from seller's and buyer's perspective and how interpersonal trust affects sellers-buyer's transaction intention. This research aims to determine the impact of perception and interaction in establishing interpersonal trust from seller's and buyer's perspective. Furthermore, this research investigates the effect of interpersonal trust on selling and purchasing intention in C2C e-Commerce sites. A quantitative approach are employed by utilizing Partial Least Square (PLS). A total of 776 responds from buyers and 106 responds from sellers are collected. The results of this study indicate that trust in sellers is influenced by seller's expertise and opportunism while trust in buyers is influenced by buyer's opportunism and buyer-seller interactions. Additionally our findings imply that trust in sellers influence buyer's purchasing intention while trust in buyers influence seller's selling intention. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Staff Website of one of big universities in Indonesia is a portal for access and information about lecturers, staff, and researchers in the university. However, the website has not fulfilled its main function. This is because the searching mechanism on the website has not matched the user's expectation, and the interface of the website is not very attractive. This research describes a project to measure the usability and user experience of the Staff Website. The evaluation results show that the website has not reached the required level of usability and user experience. Based on these results we developed an alternative design and formulated a better search mechanism for the website. This research is expected to improve the deficiencies of the Staff Website. System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to measure the usability and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to measure the broader aspect of user experience. In addition, a usability test was done to get qualitative data that could be used to improve the website and especially the search mechanism. The result of this research was a measurement of usability level, design alternative, and formulation of the search mechanism in the Staff Website. From this research, we concluded that the usability of the Staff Website needs improvement, and based on the survey results, it was urgent to generate an alternative design and a searching mechanism such as making an advanced searching mechanism, sorting and filtering buttons, and more. The new design was further evaluated with SUS and UEQ, and the results show that the website has significantly improved. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A low power wireless network has been developed for peatland monitoring system. It overcomes the drawback of GSM technology that requires high power and impractical routine top-up every certain periods. The network has been implemented by means of ESP8266 transmitter based on Arduino microcontroller. Experiments conducted over the network shows that data is successfully transferred from one to other devices using backbone and mesh topology. It is much more practical and less expensive compared to the existing network that uses GSM communication modules. Further refinement of the system would be much beneficial for replacing existing peatland monitoring system which in turn overcoming seriously routine problems caused by peatland fire in critical areas in Indonesia. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Detecting plagiarism between two papers located on different institutions cannot be done as long as there are institutions refusing to open their collection for public fearing them being plagiarized. This research developed a prototype of a cross-institutional federated document search using API-based hybrid peer-to-peer network. This approach enables searching for documents without institutions opening their collections for public. Secure link and PDF watermarking are implemented as access control methods to prevent document misuse. Emulation of text similarity detection are done using Elasticsearch. Based on the test result, we can conclude that the prototype fulfills the required business process. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Currently there are dozens of internet based applications. Each of these applications can be accessed by their user on the same application layer protocols but different pattern of payloads. For example social network applications like Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus. Each of them can be accessed using HTTPS protocol, but with different payload for each applications. It also possible to access a service in internet by using tunneled protocol, for example Bit Torrent protocol can be tunneled on top HTTP access. These kind of access modes make standard firewalls obsolete to regulate our university internet access control. In this research, we are aiming to prove whether an application layer access control can be developed using Deep Packet Inspection Method. With the deep packet inspection method, it is possible to identify applications based on their application signature. If the application signature can be identified, we can construct more robust rules to regulate university internet access control. We are developing a prototype of application layer access control using several number of free/open source software components. One of these components is Deep Packet Inspection Library-nDPI-which will become our main focus. This research also will explain the way to assemble those software components in order to perform access control functions. We are also performing a test against nDPI payload detection mechanism and the results are reported in this paper. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many software products are created by considering targeted users from different countries. For such products, it is significant to investigate users' expectations related to cultural aspects to achieve user acceptance as broad as possible in all relevant countries. The researchers of the current study examined whether the cultural background of an individual has an influence on the subjective importance of user experience (UX) aspects for several common product categories. The researchers compared findings from a previous study conducted in Germany and a replication study carried out in Indonesia. Results show significant differences concerning the rated importance of UX aspects for many product categories. However, a detailed analysis of the results also shows that the impact of culture is considerably lower than the impact of interindividual differences between persons of the same culture. In addition, both samples show quite similar rankings of the importance of UX aspects. Thus, the product type has a much bigger impact than cultural differences. © 2019 The Author(s)</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Alignment between business and information system strategies is considered as an important aspect that brings critical information for many determining indicators of the undertaking organisation. Relevant to the statement, this study used Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM) as the basis for determining the utilization level of information systems in the overall business operations. Instruments-designed preparation and description of strategy recommendations were determined through expert judgment. Software was designed to facilitate the assessment process and automate recommended strategy is needed as the result. Through this software, organisations were able to find out the position and level of information systems align with business objectives while they were also able to find out recommendations for developing future strategic plans based on their performance situation with a focus on their critical areas. Lastly, we also conducted a conformity analysis with the idea of business and technology driver in information system strategic planning. The results are useful for strategic planning. Therefore, determining the level of readiness by using a more serious combination of SAMM with business/technology driver would be a further study to be focused. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A pedagogical agent is an anthropomorphic virtual character used in an online learning environment to serve instructional purposes. The design of pedagogical agents changes over time depending on the desired objectives for them. This article is a systematic review of the research from 2007 to 2017 related to the design factors of pedagogical agents and their impact on learning environments. The objective of this review is to identify and analyze pedagogical agents through the context in which they are constructed, the independent variables used in pedagogical agent research, and the impact of the pedagogical agent implementation. The review found that research on the design of pedagogical agents has different forms, namely text, voice, 2-D character, 3-D character, and human. The independent variables used in the studies are categorized into the appearance of agents and the role of agents. Moreover, the combination of pedagogical agent designs and role designs of pedagogical agents has significant positive impacts on student learning and student behavior. Recommendations are also provided at the end of this review. © 2019, Grand Canyon University. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An online discussion forum has the potential to facilitate collaborative learning that improves students’ critical thinking. To explain the collaborative online learning experience, the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model has been proposed by a group of researchers. The model captures an in-depth and meaningful collaborative online learning process as the dynamics of social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence. Experts agree that collaborative learning using an online discussion forum requires different skills as compared to face-to-face learning activities. Currently available research on how to develop e-learning skills is still limited. This study aims to propose a training strategy of the CoI model by using the cognitive apprenticeship approach. The training is integrated with Linear Algebra classes involving 89 first-year Computer Science students at a large public university in Indonesia. The students were divided into two classes, each designed with a different learning experience. The metacognitive ability of students with the CoI training increased. They were exposed to the different learning strategies of other participants, which encouraged them to change their own strategy if needed. There was no significant change of metacognitive ability in the students who did not participate in the training. The average scores of the midterm and final exams of both classes did not differ significantly; however, students with the CoI training gave better answers to open questions that required them to argue their answer. © 2019, Grand Canyon University.

	<dc:abstract>Collaborative learning needs a careful instructional design to improve specific interaction that would trigger learning. Some previous studies show that concept map as a visualization tool is powerful to support learner to achieve a certain depth of discourse. Additionally, students also should prepare in their private workspace before creating a collaborative concept map to help them externalize and reorganize own knowledge. Difficulties appeared when students have to integrate their individual proposition with the group concept map. In this study, we use the Reciprocal Kit Build (RKB) approach to help students understand the partner's point of views and integrate it with his understanding. We measure the effect of proposed procedures on the students' learning performance based on the group map scores. Further, we also analyze how the dynamics appeared in the RKB comparison map reflected on the students' final group maps. © 2018 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

In an online learning environment, students are sometimes faced with complex tasks that can reduce learning motivation. In computer learning environment, pedagogical agents were created to promote students’ motivation and learning outcomes. In this article the application of motivation theory in the construction of pedagogical agent motivation is explored. First, the theory of motivation is explained so that it may provide a clear picture of contemporary motivation theories that sometimes may appear similar. Second, motivation theories applied in online pedagogical agents are analyzed and reviewed. At the end of the article, several directions of design research for pedagogical agent motivation for the future are illustrated. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>ICT is well known in the information society. The influence of ICT is like a pressure on life that impossible to be ignored. ICT appears in the habits of the community to communicate, interact, information sharing, especially in school community. The utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) in the school community has been extensively stated by many prominent studies. However, many of them show that there is no single universal model suitable to be adopted by all schools. This paper presents a modeling of school ICT utilization that is built by statistical causality test that reflects from empirical schools' cases. Testing the relationships among seven components of ICT utilization in schools is performed by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The seven components get their respective path coefficient levels. each hypothesis is based on research references and expert judgement. The model shows seven principal components as building which reflected from ICT utilization in schools. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Revisiting the fact that ICT development potential is still tremendous and brings us opportunities to support learning, along with the digital discrepancy, brings us the concept of technology-enhanced learning (TEL). Because learning with ICT is affected by many factors and digital divide is also a multi-faceted problem, how TEL is instantiated could be influenced so that it becomes appropriate and optimal. Because the discussion about these influencing factors for learners in TEL is massive and uses multiple points of views, we use facet analysis to explore these factors and their logical grouping along with the possible viewpoints to define TEL instantiation. Zachman's framework as the thinking paradigm is used to conduct the analysis. We analyze each Zachman's dimension for its related TEL facets. Then, we break these facets into details from abstract level into technical level. This research's result delivers a mechanism of how we regard TEL so that we can assess and improve it gradually. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Learning personalization enables system to present learning strategy based on individual learning type. In directing the personalization, the system should identify the learning type of the course participants. The learning type then will become the reference on arranging the appropriate learning strategy. Commonly, the learning type is analyzed once in the beginning of semester. Thus, the learning strategy is given with the assumption that learning type of each learner is constant. In contrast to previous studies, our research considers that learning type may change overtime and learning strategy also need adjustment to the current conditions of the learner. Therefore, the time-based analysis is necessary to acquire the detailed information related to learner's progress over time and learning type changes. This research extracted activity log from e-Learning system to identify learning type of each learner using The Tripe-Factor Approach. Our proposed system integrates automatic scheduled learning type analysis module into existing e-Learning system. Those mechanisms enable system to obtain comprehensive view of learners' behaviour and to readjust the personalized learning strategy according to learning type changes. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Strategic information system planning (SISP) has become an pivotal issue for enterprise management, especially in today's digital era. However in its implementation, the SISP process requires a variety of acting roles and the ability to share resources among the parties involved, so the success rate will also depend on the collaboration scheme being built. Examine the main aspects of the SISP collaborative scheme is objective of this paper. The results indicate that researchers are paying attention to the importance of collaboration in the SISP process, but at the same time indicating the unavailability of a holistic collaborative scheme with detailed aspects to be considered. Collaborative leadership as a basis in addition to collaborative principles such as share knowledge, share the vision, share viewpoint, active partnership approach, active communication and active participation and activities supported by the willingness of data/information and past experience, is the result of this research. Research results may be useful to other researchers and practitioners interested in collaborative schemes in the SISP process and can be a reference for them. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is very significant in determining a country's economic growth. SMEs contribution to GDP is very strong. Besides, SMEs also contribute to the employment growth in many countries. With the growing SMEs in a country, it will certainly give a positive influence on the economic development of the country. However, unfortunately many SMEs are struggling to survive and thrive with limited productivity. There are some factors that make SMEs difficult to survive, including problems of social, economic, geographic or culture, or other problems. However, the lack of successful adoption of Information Technologies is one of the factors that need to be considered. SMEs are organizations with lack of expertise, data sources, and managerial maturity. One solution that is seen in accordance with the limitations of SMEs is to use cloud-based e-Business to improve IT adoption. With cloud computing based, the proposed solution is expected not to burden SME, especially in terms of procurement infrastructure and services. The analysis conducted in this study covers three main points, namely 1) Critical Adoption Factors, 2) SME Characteristics,3) e-Business Application Solution. In this study, a preliminary idea towards a cloud-based e-business framework for SMEs is proposed. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Technological progress has changed the way teachers provide lessons and how students learn to be known as 'pedagogy'. One indicator of the achievement of learning objectives can be known based on the pedagogy that occurs during the learning process. In the e-learning system, pedagogical processes can be seen based on content usage, students' characteristics, and learning goals that capture interaction data between teachers and students with e-learning system platform. One technique that can help explore this data is Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) are two interdisciplinary fields related to data exploration derived from the educational context. LA is an approach that uses data models and analysis to find information and social relationships in order to improve teaching and learning, while EDM is a technique for processing data in algorithms and generating patterns or calculating indicators. This paper focuses on pedagogical activities in the e-learning system and presents an overview of the available literature relating to EDM and LA. The significance of this paper is to provide useful resources for academics and researchers in a concise form of the literature on the use of EDM and LA in pedagogy optimizing in e-learning systems. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The development of online learning applications has helped student and teacher passed the barriers of space and even time. On online learning, there are two types of learning based on communication method. They are synchronous and asynchronous learning. Cozora is one of online learning applications that provides both synchronous and asynchronous learning in Indonesia. This application helped student to learn directly to the lectures by using live cast. Cozora has been used by APTIKOM-AMIKOM Distance Education Program (APTIKOM-AMIKOM DE Program) to facilitate learning between student (computer science master program) and lectures. Usability and interaction design is one of important aspect in designing online learning applications. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the interaction design and usability aspect of the system. Evaluation done using online questionnaire, usability testing, and contextual interview. The study found that Cozora has implemented interaction design on its applications. However, there are still some minor improvements that can be done to improve Cozora. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The mismatch between education and job market is a growing phenomenon. The information technology (IT) industry is no exception to this issue. Amidst growing demand of skilled IT graduates, higher education institutions are often not responsive to the needs of the job market. This study is designed to explore the gap between IT education and IT job requirements. Using grounded theory, this study systematically maps the demand of IT graduates in the job market to IT graduate profiles of higher education institutions. This study also evaluates IT graduate profiles against IT certification schemes. The results indicate that mismatch may materialize if higher education institutions do not respond quickly to workforce trends. In the case of this study, the mismatch is evidenced by the emergence of new skill sets such as user experience design and digital marketing that were not fully supported by IT educational curricula. Other trends and implications are discussed. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The nature of e-Learning that accommodates many learning styles demands it to provide features that maximizes learning results, and for the knowledge itself to be perceived by applying the preferred learning styles into the learning process. An instructional design made specifically for kinesthetic learners was introduced, which was called The Instructional Design for Kinesthetic Learners, containing seven points to employ upon creating e-Learning environment. However, no evaluation has been done regarding the new instructional design. This research was conducted to implement and evaluate the aforementioned instructional design on Moodle LMS. The design and development processes were done by using ADDIE methods. This research also used a user-centered approach to understand the learners' needs. The research concluded its findings by measuring the instructional design which was already implemented on Moodle with user evaluation, qualitatively and quantitatively, by employing the usability testing and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The result shows that the e-Learning environment which implements the Instructional Design for Kinesthetic Learners has a high acceptability rate and a sign of a good user's learning effectivity rate. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this research, we propose a comprehension system model. Our model is built based on 3 requirements: divergence of business process solutions within an organization as part of automation, the importance of two-way understanding between organizations and software developers, and supporting reverse engineering goals (reconstruction, validation, and part of forward engineering). An organization can have divergences in business process solutions: non-automation, semi-automation, and automation. What two-way understanding is, developer's understanding of the software to be developed and organization's understanding of the developer. Development team's understanding against the software is built with comprehension system. The system is developed with some Instructional Design System as a foundation reference. Organizational understanding is obtained by analyzing collected data from the interaction between comprehension system and a team member. Non-automation comprehension system prototype has been tested with 82 students to produce group model (students model) and to obtain more detailed specifications of the comprehension system model. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>SCeLE is a MoodIe-based learning environment that aims to provide student-centered learning for Computer Science students of Universitas Indonesia. Over the past few years, usability tests had been conducted in order to improve the system, and according to the latest of them SCeLE has made the users feel disoriented and demotivated. The objective of this research is to provide a solution for that problem by developing a pedagogical agent that can provide automatized personalized feedbacks to students when they are learning. Once developed, the agent will be evaluated through a simulation in an environment similar to SCeLE. The evaluation results show that the agent is able to guide and motivate users in their learning. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is one of the mandatory courses at the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia as it is recommended by ACM. Competences that students need to acquire in the HCI course cover both knowledge about HCI concepts and skills to create an application by following interaction design principles or redesigning alternative interaction designs of an application. The course implements a collaborative and project-based learning approach where students are asked to complete a project in team during a semester study. The aim of the study is to investigate the students' strategies when working on their HCI projects. Based on their overall final scores, two categories of groups are observed: high-performing groups and low-performing groups. The results show that group performance in the collaborative learning gives significant effect to students' project. Effective collaboration between each member of the high-performing groups in the HCI projects resulted in more detailed prototypes and higher scores than the low-performing groups. It is also implied by the high-performing groups that they had strategies during the project. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Different needs and characteristics among e-learning users have become the main reasons behind the emerging research on e-learning personalization. One the one hand, personalization needs to determine the learning type of learner. On the other hand, learning type changes over time. This research explores the alteration of learning type using temporal data analysis. This research adapts the Triple-Factor Approach that includes learning styles, motivation, and knowledge ability in determining learning type. The objective of the current research is to explore how the different ways and a different time in capturing activity log can affect the learning type identification. The activity logs were provided by Moodle. To provide the temporal data, the activity log data were collected on four different times. On each period, the data were captured both cumulatively and non-cumulatively. The results indicated that the learning types of the learners were very likely to change from time to time. The temporal data analysis showed that the way the learners learnt, their learning motivation, and learners' knowledge level were dynamic. The intensity of one's activities at the end of the semester could be different compared to the activities in the early week. It also occurred to motivation and the level of knowledge. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Flipped classroom is one of the learning methods that flip activities between inside and outside the classroom. One of important factors to determine how good this method is is an individual learning which is conducted outside the classroom. Nowadays, most of the studies about flipped classroom focus on how to implement it with independent tools, without using learning management system (LMS). Therefore, an instructional design prepared on a LMS based on this method is needed. The instructional design was designed based on the learning process at Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia as a case study through interview and literature review. Consequently, the outcome of this research is an instructional design of flipped classroom in Moodle-based LMS within mock up form. The proposed design will become a milestone for future research in flipped classroom. Moreover, this method was expected to increase student's motivation in learning, hence the use of Moodle-based LMS becomes more optimal. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>IT Lecturers' Perceptions on the Use of Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication Tools in an Online Distance Education Program</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>PJJ APTIKOM-AMIKOM is a distance education program dedicated to help Indonesian IT lecturers get a postgraduate IT education. This distance education program uses both synchronous and asynchronous communication tools to deliver learning materials. Hence, this study focuses on the analysis of the students' perceptions when using synchronous and asynchronous communication tools in PJJ APTIKOM-AMIKOM (i.e., Cozora, WhatsApp, and Moodle Learning Management System). The aim of this study is to provide recommendations regarding the use of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools and discuss the relationship between the finding and seven principles of good practices. This study uses open-ended and close-ended questions in the form of a questionnaire distributed online to 51 participants to evaluate their performance. The data gathered from the participants were analysed using theme-based content analysis (TBCA), and the weight percentage of participants' answers was calculated. The evaluation results show that the communication tools are able to accommodate distance education and applied with some principles from seven principles of good practice in teaching such as encourage contact between students and faculty, develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, encourage active learning, and provide prompt feedback. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Online discussion forums have the potential for nurturing critical thinking skills. Online collaborative learning requires students to have learning skill to participate in discourse and interact with learning materials. An initial study conducted on first-year students of Universitas Indonesia shows that they have the ability to utilize technology for learning; however, they need to develop the ability to interact within e-learning community. In this study, we propose a training design to improve students' preparedness to take active parts in online discussion forums. One hundred and five computer science students were involved in the study. A cognitive apprenticeship approach was applied to run the training. The results show that students exhibit certain learning strategies. In addition, the level of social, cognitive, and teaching presences during the four-phases of discussion follow the same pattern. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In general, a learner knows his/her achievement at the end of the semester. When it happened, it is already too late to mend his/her grade for that course. In another case, the speed of learners to comprehend the course varies. In order to optimize the learning activities, a learner needs to be conscious on his/her learning progress as early as possible. This study explores the mechanism to guide the learner to obtain learning objectives progressively. In order to get an optimal learning objective, several factors such as learning style of each learner is detected, adaptive course materials are presented, and class assessment of each session is applied. The hypothetical step function is reviewed to capture learner progress accordingly based on those factors. For future study, this hypothetical step function will be validated and verified to several learners in many different areas of learning materials. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>User interface design for cross-ethnicity is quite common and one that would be benefited by this issue is e-Commerce. An e-Commerce which considers this issue seriously would be able to gain more interest from people, especially the people coming from rural areas where e-Commerce has not been able to reach them yet. The purpose of this study is to find out how far ethnics' culture is able to affect an e-Commerce user interface design process. Hofstede's cultural dimension questionnaire on Indonesian ethnics and an open-ended questionnaire were given to Indonesian e-Commerce consumers to acquire deeper information about the ethnics' preference. Three major ethnics in Indonesia were selected based on the respondents' cultural background. The result of these surveys then was used as a guideline to develop an e-Commerce site prototype which was later tested using usability testing methods. Based on the questionnaire and the usability testing result, we found that the three main ethnics have a similar preference and the same characteristics on e-Commerce user-interface. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research describes a component of an artifact development method that can be used as a generic method for building target artifacts with different levels of abstraction, such as: class diagrams at the analytical level, class diagrams at the design level, and Java source code at the implementation level. The component is created as an automation enabler of the artifact development method. The component name is concept representation. Currently, we have 3 type concept representation. Three types of concept representation are: concept representation as an entity representation with a separate artifact development method (CR 1); concept representation with an embedded artifact development method (CR 2); and concept representation constructed by the group as a representation of entities used together with different artifact development methods. A trial of CR3 development was conducted with 82 unique data and the findings revealed that the development of CR3 with schema helps to reduce the variability of the number of concepts and helps to guide the building of simpler category trees (ease of non-Automated realization). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many universities offer courses supplemented with online activities. Little attention, however, was given to assessing students' preparedness to engage in online learning. This study aims to investigate students' e-learning competencies. Online collaborative learning requires skills and attitudes of its own compared with face-To-face. The study was conducted at the Linear Algebra Course, Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. Fifty-six freshmen students in the second semester participate in the study. Three sources of data were used, including questionnaires, discussion transcripts, and in-depth survey. The results indicate that the students have a good technological competency, have moderate competency in interaction with learning content, and lack of interaction skills with their learning community. A recommendation to improve students' preparedness in online collaborative learning is presented. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>ICT advancement is a sure thing with the impact influencing many domains, including learning in both formal and informal situations. It leads to a new mindset that we should not only utilize the given ICT to support the learning process, but also improve it gradually involving a lot of factors. These phenomenon is called e-learning process evolution. Accordingly, this study attempts to explore maturity level concept to provide the improvement direction gradually and progression monitoring for the individual e-learning process. Extensive literature review, observation, and forming constructs are conducted to develop a conceptual framework for e-learning process maturity level. The conceptual framework consists of learner, e-learning process, continuous improvement, evolution of e-learning process, technology, and learning objectives. Whilst, evolution of e-learning process depicted as current versus expected conditions of e-learning process maturity level. The study concludes that from the e-learning process maturity level conceptual framework, it may guide the evolution roadmap for e-learning process, accelerate the evolution, and decrease the negative impact of ICT. The conceptual framework will be verified and tested in the future study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In many developing countries, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) serve as key drivers for economic growth. Despite SMEs' economic significance, their collective adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) for business activities, commonly known as e-Business, among them is generally limited. SMEs' diversity poses practical challenges to both government agencies and industry consultants looking to prescribe appropriate strategies in order to address the lack of eBusiness adoption issue for SMEs. This study attempts to establish patterns of e-Business adoption as a potential basis for future personalized strategies for SMEs. The study began by reviewing the literature for factors that might influence eBusiness adoption. A theoretical e-Business adoption model was developed based on the identified factors with which relevant hypotheses were then formulated. A questionnaire was then administered to SMEs with the objectives of measuring the influencing factors and the extent of their e-Business adoption. Data analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, using SmartPLS, we conducted factor analysis to ensure reliabilities of measurement items and subsequently tested the theoretical e-Business adoption model. From the results, the factor of e-Business expertise emerged as a significant predictor or antecedent of e-Business adoption. In the second phase, the identified adoption factors were used as a basis for cluster analysis using TwoStep algorithm. In our analysis, we argue that SMEs may be better served if their adoption problems are addressed in accordance to respective adoption patterns instead of the traditional annual-turnover-based classifications. In addition, SMEs that score high on the adoption factors tend to use more extensive e-Business applications across their value chain. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>ICT has been widely known to support educational process in the school environment. In this research, there are components of ICT adoption in education which build the framework. Framework has structures such as components' names, weights, relation amongst them and also their arrangement. This paper contains a summary and continuation of previous research to finalize the framework by expert judgement. Experts with different backgrounds such as school, government, academics, and practitioners in charge of ICT implementation in schools were invited to participate in this study,. The review was executed using Delphi method and run for several days on each review round. The experts' profound experiences enriched the information about ICT adoption in education framework from several angles. The result of this research is a proposed ICT Adoption in Education Framework (IAEF) that can be used as a reference for schools in implementing ICT. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Improving the quality of education continuously and sustainably is the task of the whole communities, but in particular the government can take over the policy on the important components by providing the best support and contribution in order to improve the quality of education and achieve the expected Information and Communication Technology (ICT) adoption goals. This study conducts user acceptance test of ICT adoption framework in schools to ensure actual system use. In this context, school is a potential user of the framework to be assessed for its acceptance of the framework by exploring acceptance characteristics such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions which mapped into perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use. This test also has a behavior analysis part by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) combination. This test is a research final phase in small scale representative sampling in order to strengthen future implementation plans. Involving about 60 schools to use the framework in the context of the preparation of adoption ICT in school. The result shows that average school responses revealed that the school administrators' lack of understanding identified needs and linked them to the intended objectives. It concludes that framework can be accepted with some suggestions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A good user experience is a must for modern software products. However, in software product design we have to often deal with conflicting requirements. A new software product feature may increase efficiency, but on the other hand decrease learnability of the product. Such types of conflicts often cause lengthy discussions, since it is often not clear which user experience aspect has the higher importance or priority for the software product. Thus, to make valid design decisions in such situations requires an understanding of the importance of different user experience aspects for different types of software products. We present a study that investigates the importance of 16 commonly used user experience aspects for a range of 15 common software product categories. The results show that the importance of the user experience aspects vary heavily between different product categories. Results can be directly used by product designers to derive some conclusions about the relative importance of different design requirements for their projects and thus help them to make good design decisions. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Augmented reality (AR) is one from many multimedia technologies which allows computer-generated content to be seamlessly overlaid and mixed into humans’ perceptions of the real world. In educational field, many researchers believe AR technology can improve user interface technology and has a huge potential implication as well as numerous benefits from the virtual augmentation of learning environments or even a teaching process. However, in the earlier researches about AR geometry educational tool, researchers did not use any pedagogical approach in its application design process. In fact, a pedagogical approach is needed for creating an effective educational application to make sure students’ learning time is spent productively. In this research, we try to create AR geometry educational tool by using design-based learning and game-based learning approach to create a better geometry educational tool. Furthermore, the application also used iterative software development lifecycle that requires a series of prototype to find the best AR game mechanics in geometry learning process. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>There are two indications that Indonesia needs to improve its education quality. The first is the Human Development Index (HDI), which is still at the medium level, and the second is the enrollment rate in higher education, which is also at the low level. MOOCs have the potential to solve both problems. However, implementing MOOCs in a developing country needs a specific analysis to determine the opportunities and challenges. This study aims to identify the opportunities and challenges in implementing MOOCs from an Indonesian perspective. We observed four local MOOCs and analyzed various documents, including literature and government regulations. As a result, this study identified seven opportunities and seven challenges in implementing MOOCs in Indonesia. Recommendations are also provided. © 2018, Matt Elbeck.

	<dc:abstract>Learning analytics is a technique to monitor a learning activity using metrics. The aim of this research was to find the impact of data filtering on metric quality, the learning analytics dashboard usability in a software development course project, and to compare a correlation-based dashboard with a randomly arranged dashboard. A quantitative method was applied, with the metric correlation set to lecturer scores; the system usability scale (SUS) was a tool for evaluating dashboards; and the Fisher-Irwin test and t-test were applied to compare dashboards. A qualitative method was applied to evaluate dashboard usability, with usability testing through lost our lease. A simple data filtering technique can improve metric quality except for code review metrics. As for usability, the learning analytics dashboard has a relatively good and acceptable SUS score of 70.75. Findings from the research reveal a significant difference between correlation-based and randomly arranged dashboards, whereas two other indicators suggest no significant differences are present. © WIETE 2018.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Student Centered e-Learning Environment (SCELE) is a Moodle-based learning management system (LMS) that has been modified to enhance learning within a computer science department curriculum offered by the Faculty of Computer Science of large public university in Indonesia. This Moodle provided a mechanism to record students’ activities when engaged in learning with e-Learning software. However, while the software captured the data and presented it adequately, there is room for enhancement and further refinement. The purpose of this research is to investigate and understand lecturer needs as they monitor student activities in SCELE and then develop a learning monitoring tool capable of visualizing and collecting data in a form that facilitates lecturer observation, analysis, and targeting of specific concepts. Theories found within information architecture and information visualization are used as a foundational approach in the development of the application. The result of the research focuses on developing a learning dashboard Moodle plugin that can be easily utilized by lecturers engaging SCELE. © 2018, Matt Elbeck. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

Based on extensive literature review about e-Learning service quality guidelines, as well as the observation of existing Open Education services, we formulated Open Education Metric (OEM). OEM consists of 37 indicators which are divided into six criteria: (1) Openness, (2) Benefit, (3) Delivery, (4) Learning, (5) Evaluation, and (6) Support. Evaluation scheme is designed to give a clear guideline in assessing the quality of OE service quantitatively. The evaluation results including score and category indicate the overall quality relative to a set of indicators. Trial of evaluation was conducted using the evaluation system based on OEM to test its performance in evaluating OE service quality in institutions. Three of OE services were evaluated with their scores. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Learning can be a tool in monitoring learning process and progress towards the targeted competency. Process and progress on every learner can be different one to another, since every learner may have different learning type. Learning type itself can be identified by taking into account learning style, motivation, and knowledge ability. This study explores personalization for learning type based on Triple-Factor Approach. Considering that factors in Triple-Factor Approach are dynamic, the personalization system needs to accommodate the changes that may occurs. Originated from the issue, this study proposed personalization that guides learner progression dynamically towards stages of their learning process. The personalization is implemented in the form of interventions that trigger learner to access learning contents and discussion forums more often as well as improve their level of knowledge ability based on their state of learning type. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents preliminary research findings on the ICT adoption framework for education. Despite many studies have been conducted on ICT adoption framework in education at various countries, they are lack of analysis on the degree of component contribution to the success to the framework. In this paper a set of components that link to ICT adoption in education is observed based on literatures and explorative analysis. The components are Infrastructure, Application, User Skills, Utilization, Finance, and Policy. The components are used as a basis to develop a questionnaire to capture the current ICT adoption condition in schools. The data from questionnaire are processed using Structured Equation Model (SEM). The results show that each component contributes differently to the ICT adoption framework. Finance provides the strongest affect to Infrastructure readiness, whilst User Skills provides the strongest affect to Utilization. The study concludes that development of ICT adoption framework should consider components contribution weights among the components that can be used to guide the implementation of ICT adoption in education. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Every student has different learning styles. They have tendency in perceiving, interacting and processing information they have learned. Those tendencies can be identified by assessing stodente' learning styles using the Index of Learning Style (ILS). ILS is commonly used to identify engineering student's learning style in learning personalization system. However, this questionnaire is developed in English language. Moreover, this study aims to give contribution in translating the questionnaire to Indonesian version. Hence, students who have Indonesian language as their mother tongue could easily understood the questionnaire. This study also describes the validity and the reliability score of the ILS adaptation to Indonesian version. There are four statements in Indonesian version of ILS that need to be revised. The Cronbach's alpha for the translated ILS is.602 that is reliable enough. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As a key aspect of product development, usability of a product is needed to be assessed by conducting usability evaluation. Within the usability evaluation methods, there are several usability assessment questionnaires; one of the most commonly used is the System Usability Scale (SUS). However, the SUS is originally developed in English and there had not been any study conducted to develop the Indonesian version of SUS. The adapted version is expected to help usability researchers and practitioners in Indonesia while conducting usability product evaluation. Therefore, this study was carried out to adapt the original SUS into the Indonesian version by using cross-cultural adaptation and reliability test. The Cronbach's Alpha of the Indonesian adaptation of SUS was 0.841, which concludes that this version is reliable to be used by usability practitioners. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The current research aims to investigate the relationship between high school student's computer self-efficacy and their cognitive actions and metacognitive strategies while engaged in an interactive learning module. While the computer self-efficacy represents self-efficacy component, the cognitive actions represent the activities while using the modules. The metacognitive component was represented by planning, monitoring and regulating strategies. Students at two high schools in the state of Utah in the United States of America were the target research population. They enrolled in programming and math classes offered by school abc and a physics class offered by school xyz. One hundred students participated in this study. This study focuses on three ILM modules that represent some fundamental concepts in computer science. Three questionnaires were used: demographic questionnaire, computer self-efficacy questionnaire and self-regulated computer-based learning questionnaire. The results show that computer self-efficacy is positively correlated with cognitive actions. There is no significant correlation that exists between computer self-efficacy and components of metacognitive strategies. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Learning environment has been extended not just in physical environment but also in virtual environment. Active learning activity such as discussion can take place virtual environment using discussion forum. Learning management system provides this feature and several other learning activities. Students use the discussion forum to discuss issues or enquire information of related topics stimulated by the teacher or lecturer or by the students themselves. Interaction between students would take place in this discussion forum, a student may post in-reply to others or add a new post. The layout of a typical discussion forum is leading to the difficulty of analyze the interaction network between students and thus identifying who is the most influential student or the most dominant student in the discussion forum. In our research, we used theories from social network analysis (a part of complex network) to build an interaction network between students in the forum and used the degree centrality metric to detect the most influential student in the discussion forum. We extracted the online discussion forum data from the database of a moodle-based learning management system used in our university which is called SCeLE, short for student-centered learning environment. We focused on one course which has several parallel classes. Despite having a very low number of students participating in the online discussion forum, we have managed to identify the most influential student in the discussion forum using degree centrality metric. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the past ten years, adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education is growing rapidly in almost every country in the world as an enabler to achieve the schools' goal. Despite many success reports on ICT adoption in education, there are many other studies conclude that ICT adoption in education is still a challenging problem. One of remaining challenge is how to identify key components for successful ICT adoption in school. The objective of this research is to explain some steps on how to identify and evaluate these components of ICT adoption using data-driven (bottom-up) approach. This method has been tested using primary data from schools in Indonesia. Findings of this empiric research reflect the components of ICT adoption in education. The components and their weights are: ICT Facilities (weight=20.35%), Utilizing ICT in school administration (weight=14.89%), Utilizing ICT in teaching and learning (weight=12.71%), User skill (weight = 11.52%), Policy (weight=6.61%), Financial (weight=6.53%), and Basic ICT Infrastructure (weight=6.29%), that constitute 78.9% of total information from 50 variables. Weighting information of each components may represent to policy makers about which components can be prioritized in setting up an ICT adoption budget. Countries with different budget restrictions may need this weighting information of each components in setting up an ICT budget.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In order to facilitate self-monitoring interventions designed by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia a web-based self-monitoring tool was created. This paper aims to evaluate the tool regarding its usability and user-experiences prior to its wide adoption. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and the User-Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were used to evaluate the selfmonitoring tool. The tool was implemented in a Human-Computer Interaction course during odd semesters, and the evaluations were taken by the participants of the course. The evaluation results were analysed to help determine whether the tool needs to be enhanced or improved. Based on the results, a new design of self-monitoring tool was developed using the interface design principles.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Beling.co is an e-Learning website which has an objective to facilitate learning basic programming for Indonesian teenagers in a fun way. However, verification research to test whether Beling.co has achieved this objective is still warranted. Therefore, this research proposes to evaluate and improve the interactive capabilities and design of Beling.co. This research involved 23 high school students in Depok city, West Java, Indonesia. Three evaluation techniques were used in the study including expert evaluation, usability testing, and a desirability toolkit. The research concluded that Beling.co has a simple interactive design and is capable of motivating users to learn programming. The research reveals requirements needed to improve the interactive design of Beling.co. © 2016 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One promising approach for pixel-wise semantic segmentation is based on higher-order Conditional Random Fields (CKFs). We aim to selectively choose segments for the higher-order CRFs in semantic segmentation. To this end, we formulate the selection as an optimization problem. We propose three optimization criteria in relation to the selected segments, namely: a) averaged goodness, b) coverage area and c) non-overlapped area. Essentially, we desire to have best segments with maximum coverage area and maximum non-overlapped area. We apply two evolutionary optimization algorithms, namely: the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The goodness of segments is estimated using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach. Experiment results show that semantic segmentation with GA-or-PSO-selected segments yields competitive semantic segmentation accuracy in comparison to that of naively using all segments. Moreover, the fewer number of segments used in semantic segmentation speeds up its computation time up to six times faster. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The aim of the current study is to develop an adapted version of User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and evaluate a learning management system. Although there is a growing interest on User Experience, there are still limited resources (i.e. measurement tools or questionnaires) available to measure user experience of any products, especially learning management systems. Two hundreds and thirteen computer science students participated and completed the adapted version of UEQ. In the study, the researchers used a learning management system named Student Centered e-Learning Environment (SCELE). Several types of learning materials are posted in SCELE such as audio files, simulations, PowerPoint slides, multimedia contents, and webpage links. Most of the lecturers use discussion forums in their courses to encourage students to participate in active learning setting. Staff and lecturers sometimes post academic-related announcements on the SCELE homepage. Two hundred thirteen students enrolled in Computer Science program were invited to evaluate the SCELE. This study will benefit UX practitioners, HCI educators, program and center of learning resources administrators, and learning management system developers. Findings of the present study may also be valuable for universities and high schools which are using computer-based learning environments. © 2016, Matt Elbeck. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Most HCI-related courses offered by the universities in Indonesia are delivered using conventional face-to-face methods. This paper describes the preliminary findings from the implementation of active learning instructional strategies in a blended undergraduate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) unit offered by the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia. The study was conducted with one hundred and twenty-two students enrolled in the Computer Science and Information System programs. The face-to-face teaching and learning activities, i.e. lectures, project-based group activities, hands-on learning experiences, and assessment of this unit are supported by a Moodle-based learning management system named Student Centered e-Learning Environment (SCELE). The students were encouraged to explore the topics through social learning interaction in SCELE. Their knowledge and skills were further constructed through the face-to-face learning activities. Active learning instructional methods were applied throughout the unit to deepen their understanding and skills in Human-Computer Interaction. In this paper, we present qualitative data collected about the students' perceptions of their new learning experiences in this unit. © 2015 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Development of gamification-enriched pedagogical agent for e-learning system based on community of inquiry</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Researchers have recognized that the success impact of e- Learning is not only affected by technical aspect but also pedagogical one. Facilitators in online learning class should be able to motivate their students to be active learners. One of the ways to do so is by giving personalized feedback. However, this is quite difficult to be applied. Therefore, the idea of developing a pedagogical agent arose to help the facilitators in providing automatic feedback to the students based on their behavior in e-Learning system. The pedagogical agent in the current study was built based on Community of Inquiry (CoI) model and enriched with gamification concept to be more attractive. The proposed design of pedagogical agent was evaluated by one-week online learning simulation, feedback form filling, and focus group discussion. The pedagogical agent is hoped to be able to boost students' motivation to use e-Learning system optimally, so that the learning objectives could be accomplished. Copyright © 2015 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The transition from individual and dependent learning style into collaborative and self-regulated learning is a challenge for new students in higher education. Self-monitoring process is one of the methods that can be used to answer the challenge. In addition, lecturers also need to monitor students' understanding about certain topics. A web-based selfmonitoring tool was developed using prototyping paradigm and user-centered design process. The features of the tool include create prompts, view the students' answers by the prompt or student's name, and give feedback to the students based on keywords appeared on their answers. Usability testing was conducted to measure how usable is the system. We then revised the system from the users' recommendations.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Student Centered e-Learning Environment (SCeLE) has substantial roles to support learning activities at Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia (Fasilkom UI). Although it has been utilized for about 10 years, the usability aspect of SCeLE as an e-Learning system has not been evaluated. Therefore, the usability aspects of SCeLE Fasilkom UI as a learning support system is not well-acquainted yet. Accordingly, the researchers are in need of conducting a usability evaluation in order to propose a set of recommendation for SCeLE usability improvement, based on usability evaluation reflecting both students and lecturers experience as user. In this present research, the usability testing was conducted for SCeLE, targeting learning activities underwent by undergraduate students at Fasilkom UI, in the form of blended mode online learning. The data collection stage in the usability testing was performed by distributing questionnaires to students and interviewing several lecturers and students. The collected data were then analyzed and interpreted in order to obtain usability problems and solution alternatives. The quantitative data were analyzed using the mean as a reference, while the qualitative data were analyzed using theme-based content analysis. Data interpretation was performed by determining how to handle each kind of data based on its theme, and classifying each of the identified usability problem referring to its severity rating. The recommendations were constructed based on solution alternatives from the analyzed data supported by literature study. The present research comes up with seven main recommendations and an extra recommendation. The main recommendations are solutions to tackle the identified usability problems, while the extra recommendation is not directly related to any of identified usability problems, but was considered potential to improve the SCeLE usability. © Junus, Santoso, Isal, and Utomo.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Around two-hundred million Indonesians live in the country's over 17 thousand islands, leaving a big 'homework' for the government regarding education, particulary on how to increase the participation rate and quality of educational services. Online distance education can be used to improve the quality of education and increase the number of students. In addition, openly available distance education may encourage prospective students to pursue their education. The Association of College and Universities in Indonesia, which offers educational programs in computing, information systems, and technology (APTIKOM), has successfully designed a framework for Indonesia Open Educational Resources (I-OER). The framework consists of three components: Open Content (OCT), OpenCourseWare (OCW), and Open Education (OED). The present paper aims to discuss the concept of I-OER and the development of I-OER platform. The OCT, OCW, and OED are integrated into the I-OER platform. The platform is currently developed by a team at a reputable university in Indonesia. Specifically for OCT, ontology-based learning object searching technique is applied. Through OCT everyone can share their learning content freely and openly. Moreover, the learning contents on OCT can be reorganized by applying instructional design principles to create complete course materials under OCW. Education professionals (e.g., lecturers, teachers, practitioners and experts from schools, universities, and research centers) are welcome to become contributors. In addition, APTIKOM introduces OED to encourage students and Indonesian citizens in general to obtain certifications or credit points for credit transfer in the future.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The development of e-learning cannot be separated from the creation of learning objects which are always improving and more diverse. In this study, we propose a technique to perform learning object searching that use a granular learning object concept using ontology representation. The concept of granular learning objects is done by separating the materials with their sub-materials. A semantic web-based search engine is also used to explore existing learning objects. The result of the research shows that the implementation of granular leaning object ontology, and semantic web-based search engine, can improve searching performance by 29,7% better than search engine which uses document index-based searching technique. The search results do not only show the general description of a learning object, but can also show the sub-materials and the relationships among those materials. An information in the form of pictures and their descriptions about the retrieved learning object can also be displayed. Copyright 2014 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the emerging issue in e-learning is to create adaptive learning based on learner's perspective. Adaptive learning can be realized through personalization of e-learning. Personalized learning help learners to use their best performance in order to reach learning goals based on their needs, preferences, and characteristics. To accomodate different characteristics of the learners, learning content personalization system based on triple-factor learning type was developed. The characteristics of 36 triple-factor learning type were used as input for learning content personalization algorithm to produce learning content that suitable for the learners's learning type. The algorithm implemented into a system which called SCELE-Personalization Dynamic E-learning. The system was used by 118 learners in Science Writing course at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia as experimental group. In order to find the best learning performance, the exam score from experiment group were compared with the exam score from control group. The result shows learning performance of experimental group that used personalized learning feature is better than learning performance of control group who used non-personalized learning feature. It can be seen from significant value (p&lt;0,05) and the different mean score of the experimental group that reach 13,68. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Metacognition is the process of thinking about thinking, which refers to students' ability to control cognition to ensure that learning goals are achieved or a problem is solved. It is a complex process that depends on and influences students' understanding about themselves as thinkers and learners, and usually precedes and follows cognitive activity. Metacognitive skill plays a particularly critical role in real-life or open-ended tasks, such as solving ill-structured design problems. While there is growing interest in metacognitive research, few assessment tools have been developed in the context of engineering design, particularly within classroom environments. The objective of the present paper is to discuss the process of Engineering Design and Metacognitive Questionnaire (EDMQ) development and initial validation, specifically the process of face and content validity. The instrument development is grounded in Butler and Cartier's self-regulated learning (SRL) model which describes the interplay between motivation, cognition, and metacognition within academic activities such as design. The questionnaire is adapted from their works include the Inquiry Learning Questionnaire and the Learning through Reading Questionnaire. A rubric matrix combined Butler and Cartier's SRL features and the Dym and Little's design process and team management components was used in the instrument development. Dym and Little contended that the design process consists of five phases: problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, and design communication. The EDMQ include items that address cognitive strategies both in design process and team management activities. Three subsections of the EDMQ were designed to capture students' perception of metacognition at the early, middle, and final stages of the design task across design processes, respectively; the first subsection of EDMQ captures task interpretation and planning strategies; the second subsection captures cognitive actions and monitoring and fix-up strategies; the third subsection captures students' judgment of their design outcomes. Six undergraduate engineering students were invited in the face validity process. Moreover, the content validity involved two engineering professors and two experts in self-regulated learning. The resulting survey instrument contains 127 questionnaire items assessing five SRL features: Task interpretation, planning strategies, cognitive actions, monitoring and fix-up strategies, and criteria of success. This survey instrument may be useful for cognitive and metacognitive research and assessing design processes in the context of engineering design project. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate students' self-regulated learning (SRL) skills used in a Web-intensive learning environment. The research question guiding the study was: How did the use of student SRL skills and student engagement in online activities compare between higher- and lower-performing students participating in a Web-intensive engineering course? Specific focus was given to exploring how higher- and lower-performing students' forethought, performance control, and self-reflection as well as how their online activities differed. In this study, a Web-intensive course was defined as a unique online learning environment where lectures are broadcasted through Web conferencing software while students participate in the lectures from a computer laboratory, facilitated by teaching assistants. Fifty-seven valid data sets were analyzed from questionnaire, data logs provided by a learning management system, ranking questions, and project performance. The findings suggest that higher performers outperformed lower performers significantly on goal setting. On the other hand, lower performers reported a significant higher score on task strategies than their higher-performing peers. Regarding students' online activities, higher performers accessed all course materials significantly more frequently than lower performers. Furthermore, when evaluating the promptness of assignment submission, the results found the higher performers showed that they were significantly more prompt than lower performers in submitting their assignments. This article also outlines suggestions for further research in the Web-intensive course.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Literature suggests that note-taking activity helps students in their learning process and successfully increases performance. Previous studies also have suggested that collaborative learning facilitates students to learn from different views of interpreting information. Although many studies have revealed positive correlations between collaborative learning and student performance, few studies have been conducted to investigate peer-review activity, students' performance, and self-regulated learning skills while engaged in shared note-taking using electronic enhanced guided notes. The main research question of the current study was to investigate how students' review frequency of peers' enhanced guided notes and learning performance reflected on their self-regulated learning skills. With regards to this question, we specifically explored differences among students according to their peer-review activity and performance and how the differences reflected on their self-regulated learning skills. Our findings revealed four groups of students based on those differentiation factors. Data analysis showed that while sixty percent of participants were willing to review their peers' enhanced guided notes regularly, sixty-eight percent of participants performed very well on the exams. Results also suggest that willingness to review peers' guided notes positively correlated with planning and cognitive strategies. Implications of the use of shared note-taking in an engineering classroom will be discussed. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Previous studies suggested that the implementation of note-taking strategies impacted students' learning process and performance. Research also suggested that collaborative learning facilitates students to learn from different views of interpreting information. The objective of this study was to investigate students' metacognitive skills and social networks while using electronic and paper-based enhanced guided notes. Students' worked in groups of three or four to complete the EGN. The impact of the collaborative note-taking activities on the students' collaboration processes was examined using social network analysis. Our findings revealed that students' cognitive and metacognitive strategies between electronic and paper-based EGN groups were relatively similar. Our data analysis of students' social networks revealed two clusters of students, high and low groups that represented the level of students' connectivity in a collaborations network. The findings suggested that the high group outperformed students in the low group in the use of cognitive, monitoring, and regulating strategies. Implications of the use of collaborative note-taking in engineering classroom will be discussed. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Along with the rapid development of computer and Internet technologies, efforts have been conducted to include design, development, and evaluation of computer applications for learning activities. Although extensive research has defined the use of computer applications in various disciplines, few studies have systematically investigated students' self-regulated learning skills while learning with an interactive learning module specifically in computer science education. The purposes of this study are to investigate high school students' computer self-efficacy, cognitive, and metacognitive strategies while students learn with the interactive learning modules and performing a mixed-methods study. Data collection included students' self-reports and traces of student activity. The quantitative analyses applicable to this study included descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Qualitative data were gathered from interactive learning module screen-captured videos and interview transcripts to support findings from quantitative data. The outcome of this study will inform policy makers, educators, researchers, developers, and others of the importance of a self-regulated learning perspective when designing instruction using an interactive learning module. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Measuring self-regulated learning (SRL) skills of engineering college students while using enhanced guided notes (EGN) promotes a better understanding of how students deal with notetaking activities. This study focused on students' task interpretation, cognitive strategies, and SRL processes including planning, monitoring, and regulating strategies while using EGN in an electric circuits course. The main objectives of this study were to (1) understand how students' SRL skills changed after using EGN; and (2) evaluate how students' conceptual understanding on electric circuits improved after using EGN. Ninety-seven students enrolled in the Fundamental Electronics for Engineers course at a land grant university participated in the study. A self-regulated learning survey instrument developed using Butler and Cartier's SRL model was used to capture students' task interpretation, cognitive strategies, and SRL processes. In addition, Holton's DC/AC Circuits Concept Inventory was used to measure students' conceptual understanding of DC/AC concepts. Participants were asked to complete both surveys twice online, at the beginning and end of the semester. Descriptive statistics, independent and paired t-tests, and a cluster analysis technique were used to analyze data. Data analysis of the SRL survey revealed that students had different SRL profiles. Students in the improved group reported a significant improvement in planning, monitoring, and regulating strategies. On the other hand, those in the declined group showed a lower awareness of all SRL skills at the end of semester. Furthermore, the findings revealed an improvement in students' conceptual understanding. This article will also discuss the potential implications for electric circuit concepts instruction. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper examines the task interpretation and strategy use of higher-and lower-performing college freshmen while engaged in an engineering design project using a self-regulated learning (SRL) framework. Our goals were to consider how students' interpretation of task demands could be associated with their use of planning, cognitive, and monitoring/fix-up strategies, both as part of the design process and when managing their time, resources and teamwork. The main research question that guided the study was: In what ways did higher-vs. lower-performing students differ when engaged in an engineering design project? With regards to this question, we specifically explored how these two groups of students were similar or different in their: (1) task interpretation in relation to reported strategy use during the design process; and (2) task interpretation in relation to reported strategy use in project management. Seventy freshman engineering students enrolled in an introductory engineering design course at Utah State University were recruited for the study. From among that group, data from 20 higher-and 12 lower-performers were selected for analysis. Survey instruments and Web-based design journal entries were used to capture students' task interpretation, reported strategy use, including planning (PS), cognitive (CS), and monitoring/fix-up strategies (MF), and perceptions of important performance criteria (CR). Students' design performance was evaluated by the teacher. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics and graphical views were used to analyze student SRL profiles. Entries from students' design journals were coded using an SRL model and interpreted to triangulate and complement survey data to achieve deeper insight about SRL between the two groups. The findings suggested that both higher-and lower-performers were highly aware of important task requirements. However, higherperforming students had a greater awareness and reported greater use of monitoring and fix-up strategies associated with success in the design process. The higher-performing students also obtained higher scores on criteria for performance than lower-performing students, both in the design process and project management. Furthermore, journal writings revealed that higher performers were more thorough in identifying and describing design requirements and strategies for their projects than were the lower performers. This paper discusses the potential implication for design instruction in engineering college freshmen. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The current study evaluated engineering college students' self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies while learning electric circuit concepts using enhanced guided notes (EGN). Our goal was to describe how students exercise SRL strategies and how their grade performance changes after using EGN. Two research questions guided the study: (1) To what degree students' grade performance change after using the EGN; and (2) To what degree students' SRL profiles change after using the EGN? The subjects for this study were 97 engineering students enrolled in the Fundamental Electronics for Engineers course at a university in Utah. A survey instrument developed using Butler and Cartier's SRL model was used to capture SRL strategies with a focus on the sixth feature which includes including planning, monitoring, and regulating. Regular examinations and the DC/AC conceptual inventory were used to assess grade performance. Descriptive statistics, independent and paired t-tests, and a cluster analysis technique were used to analyze survey data. A phenomenological data analysis was used to analyze interview transcripts to support findings from questionnaire data. The findings revealed an improvement on students' grade performance. Data analysis of the SRL survey revealed that students' had different SRL profiles. Students in the improved group reported a greater awareness of planning, monitoring, and regulating strategies. On the other hand, those in the declined group showed a lower awareness of the SRL strategies at the end of semester. In addition, emergent themes related to students' SRL and learning experience while using the EGN were found. This article will also discuss the potential implications for electric circuit concepts instructions.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The current study was part of activities in a Work in Progress paper presented at the 41st Frontiers in Education Conference that focused on activity Phase 2. This study evaluated students' metacognition using the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework while learning electric circuit concepts. Two research questions guided this study: (1) Was there any improvement in metacognitive self-regulation skills while learning using the enhanced guided notes (EGN) throughout the semester?, and (2) To what degree were students' monitoring strategies reflected in regulating strategies at the beginning and end of the semester? The subjects for this study were engineering students enrolled in the Fundamental Electronics for Engineers course at Utah State University during the fall 2011. Thirteen sets of EGN were developed and used in the semester. A survey instrument developed using Butler and Cartier's SRL model was used to capture students' metacognitive self-regulated learning strategies. Participants were asked to complete the survey twice; at the beginning and end of semester. Descriptive statistics and mean differences of SRL features were used to analyze survey data. Mean differences were conducted in two ways: (1) comparing mean values of the same SRL items, and (2) comparing the level/quality between SRL features for two themes (i.e., knowledge acquisition and problem solving) at the beginning and end of the semester. The findings suggested that there were improvements in some aspects of monitoring and regulating strategies. Comparison of SRL item mean values revealed that there was increasing awareness on specific SRL items. Students did a good job in monitoring and regulating strategies for knowledge acquisition and problem solving. They successfully improved the quality of SRL feature in knowledge acquisition and maintained the quality level in problem solving. This article will also discuss the potential implications for electric circuit concepts instruction. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The implementation of this phase included: (1) implementing enhanced guided-notes (EGN) with a collaborative note-taking effort; and (2) evaluating students' notes shared in collaborative notebooks. Selected students were provided an iPad 2 TM and an application which allowed editing of the EGN, while other students were provided hard copies of the different sets throughout the semester. Furthermore, students were asked to complete online social networking surveys at the beginning and end of the semester. The instructor developed EGN to facilitate note-taking and note-sharing during the semester. An online repository system was created to allow iPad-groups of students to complete and edit EGNs that were created to facilitate note-sharing submission. Students worked in groups of three or four to complete the EGN and self-evaluation sections beginning in EGN 6 and continuing to EGN 11. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this study, the relationship between students' interest in engineering design activities and their expectancy for success in grades 9-12 was evaluated. The theoretical frameworks developed by Eccles and colleagues (i.e., expectancy value) and Butler and Cartier (i.e., what the students bring to contexts under a self-regulated learning framework) were used to frame the relationship between students' interest and expectancy for success. Specifically, this study extends the value part with interest by using psychological constructs of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Three psychological constructs were used to evaluate students' interest: intrinsic goal orientation (IGO), extrinsic goal orientation (EGO), and task value (TV). Two other psychological constructs were used to evaluate students' expectancy for success in completing the design tasks: control of learning beliefs (CLB) and self-efficacy for learning and performance (SELP). A total of 113 students participated in the study. These students participated in five schools (in three states) that implement the Project Lead the Way curriculum. After finishing their design project, each student was asked to complete a modified version of the MSLQ survey instrument that evaluated the five aforementioned constructs. From a statistical test, it was found that there was a significant relationship between students' interest in the engineering design tasks and their expectancy for success. Further statistical tests also indicated significant relationships between each construct of the interest and expectancy components. From a regression test, it was found that students' intrinsic goal orientation and task value were significant predictors, each contributing about 55 and 34 percent, respectively, to students' expectancy for success. © International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Asynchronous online discussion is used to facilitate communication between instructor and student, and also among fellow students. Although this communication tool is a frequently-used feature of e-learning systems, there is still a limited number of studies evaluating the cognitive implications of this online discussion. This study aims to evaluate students' discourse in online discussion by using a cognitive framework analysis. The goal is to identify factors that influence the construction of discussion patterns from a cognitive perspective. The discussion topics are selected based on several criteria, including the content of discussion topics, the person who initiates the discussion, the number of discussion threads, and the type of selected courses.

	<dc:abstract>Design tasks are ubiquitous, complex, ill-structured, and challenging to students and professional engineering designers. Successful designing depends on having not only adequate knowledge but also sufficient awareness and control of that knowledge, known as metacognition. Research suggests that metacognition not only enhances learning outcomes but also encourages students to be self-regulated learners who are metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their learning process. This article evaluates the extent to which students' task interpretation of the design project is reflected in their working plans and monitoring/regulating strategies. Butler and Cartier's Self- Regulated Learning (SRL) model was used to evaluate the dynamic and iterative interplay between metacognitive and cognitive activity. SRL dimensions such as design process, task management, task value, and criteria of success were evaluated. Twelve freshman engineering students at Utah State University participated in the study while they engaged in an engineering design project for a mechanical engineering course, "Engineering Graphics." Students were asked to complete the Engineering Design Questionnaire (EDQ) at the early, middle, and final stages of the project. Data collected were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively using graphical views. In addition, the mean value of each item from the same SRL dimension was compared across SRL episodes (i.e., task interpretation, planning strategies, cognitive strategies, monitoring and fix-up strategies, and criteria). From the analysis, the findings suggest that the level of understanding of the task was clearly reflected in students' plans with particular emphasis on getting a good overview of the design task at the early stage of the project. Students were found to be lacking in the areas of planning the methods used and anticipating the time required to solve the design task at the early stage of the project. Overall, students excelled in monitoring and regulating the design process and task management, although lower scores were found on several activities, such as seeking alternative approaches to investigating the problem, design solution, time planning, and the effective use of resources and materials during the project. When regarding their criteria of success, students considered task management issues to be more important than issues relating to the design process. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Exploring metacognitive skills in students' engineering design activities has merit for better understanding how the students deal with problem solving. This understanding will benefit the students, engineering educators, and curriculum developers. Researchers realize that metacognitive assessment is a complex endeavor that suggests the need of using data triangulation protocols. A mixed-methods approach to research is also needed to gather comprehensive and valid information about student metacognition. Among many other data collection methods, the semi-structured interview is a widely used method. The semi-structured method offers high flexibility and interaction with the students while providing a consistent framework for interviews. The objectives of this preliminary study were to investigate students' activities that reflect their metacognition, and to suggest what preparation should be undertaken during a semi-structured interview. Engineering graphics (MAE 1200) students (n=4) in the College of Engineering, at Utah State University (USU), participated in this preliminary study. Butler and Cartier's Self-Regulated Learning model was used to frame interview questions. Two graduate students in the Department of Engineering and Technology Education (ETE) conducted interview sessions to assess the participants' task interpretations, strategies, monitoring activities, and judgments about their design at the early and final stages of a design project. Participant responses were categorized and tabulated according to interview questions. The results suggest that there was a change in both task interpretation and strategy during the engineering design activity. Additionally, time constraints and skill level with the software affected student monitoring strategies in completing the design task. Most participants were satisfied with their design result. In addition, issues and challenges, as well as suggestions for conducting the semi-structured interview, are discussed in the paper. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Probabilistic Neural Network has received considerable attention nowadays and obtained many successful application. This type of neural system has shown marvelous higher recognition capability compare with that of Back-Propagation neural system. However, this neural system shown some drawbacks, especially on determining the value of its smoothing parameter and huge neural structure when large numbers of data are necessary. Supervised-structure determination of PNN is an algorithm to solve these problems by selecting a set of valuable neurons using Orthogonal Algorithm and determining the optimal smoothing parameter value using Genetic Algorithm. In this paper an experimental set up for comparison of the Supervised-structure determination of PNN with that of the Standard PNN as a neural classifier in the Odor Recognition System is conducted. Experimental results show that the Supervised-structure determination of PNN performed higher recognition rate compare with that of Standard PNN, even using lower number of neurons.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Wind turbines or wind farms present a major source of renewable energy. The expansion of wind turbines across the world rapidly increases. Unfortunately, for radar systems, wind turbines are a big source of clutter that can negatively influence the behavior of the detection capabilities of radar systems, or even totally 'blind' radar systems. The problematic of mitigation of the influence of the wind turbines on radar systems is highly variable and depends on parameters of the wind turbines and radar systems. The main negative parameters of wind turbines are large Radar Cross Sections and Doppler shift spread of reflected signals. For the determination of general mitigation techniques, it is important to make a deep analysis of the different types of scenarios using a developed simulator of reflected signals from a wind turbine. This paper describes developed simulator and wind turbine parameter analysis. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Relation among objects can be connected with at least one object feature, and a feature can describe one or more objects. Object relation with feature set form an undirected multigraph which can be represented as hypergraph. In our previous work, we developed adjaceny hyperedges matrix which are hypergraph model representing undirected multigraph so that we can identify the type of the object connection. In partial similar object collection, there may exist composite object relation, which is a relation among objects satisfying proper superset operation based on the set of object feature. Composite object relation is one form of abstraction (higher level) relation among objects. In composite object relation, each proper superset object has direct connection in the form of transitive path into objects in its own subset, and also form transitive closure. In this paper, we propose object connection algorithm and composite object relationship algorithm. The Objective of the first algorithm is to determine a collection objects dataset which is totally different, partially similar, or identical objects. The objective of the second algorithm is to identify composite objects relationship in a collection of objects, also to construct the objects that form connection as partially order set. Our experiments support our proposed algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

After Graphical Proceessing Unit (GPU) introduced not only for graphical necessary but also for general purpose computing, segmentation process which is computationally expensive can be potentially improved. The good accuracy of detection and segmentation result provides morphological information for the pathologist. Consequently, more approaches were developed to ensure the good performance of detection and segmentation such as deep learning approach.

	<dc:abstract>An automatic detection of histopathological images has an important role in helping diagnose step. Even, for determining the status of cancer, benign or malignant A conventional way in cancer detection has infirmity like user dependency, the tendency to the incorrect identification and takes more time. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the deep learning architecture that can accommodate automatic feature extraction and classification directly. The ability of CNN to extract a feature of an image in depth underlie our research. The research aims to classify the two statuses of cancer on gland images using CNN. The training process for six, eight and ten layers exploited on this research. The accuracy obtained up to 82.98, 81.91 and 89.36 percent for six, eight and ten layers respectively. But in the future, we need to improve the computing time. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The rapid growth of information technology and internet access has moved many offline activities online. Cloud computing is an easy and inexpensive solution, as supported by virtualization servers that allow easier access to personal computing resources. Unfortunately, current virtualization technology has some major disadvantages that can lead to suboptimal server performance. As a result, some companies have begun to move from virtual machines to containers. While containers are not new technology, their use has increased recently due to the Docker container platform product. Docker's features can provide easier solutions. In this work, insilico drug discovery applications from molecular modelling to virtual screening were tested to run in Docker. The results are very promising, as Docker beat the virtual machine in most tests and reduced the performance gap that exists when using a virtual machine (VirtualBox). The virtual machine placed third in test performance, after the host itself and Docker. © IJTech 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia has high mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases. To minimize the mortality, we build a tele-ecg system for heart diseases early detection and monitoring. In this research, the tele-ecg system was enhanced using Hadoop framework, in order to deal with big data processing. The system was build on cluster computer with 4 nodes. The server is able to handle 60 requests at the same time. The system can classify the ecg data using decision tree and random forest. The accuracy is 97.14% and 98,92% for decision tree and random forest respectively. Training process in random forest is faster than in decision tree, while testing process in decision tree is faster than in random forest. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The analysis is based on the behavior of a Cross Ambiguity function and is done for one/more targets in one bistatic radar. The Single Frequency Network system uses the same central carrier frequency for all transmitters. The analysis shows that multipath effect significantly influences the determination of the precise accuracy of the maximum of the CA function. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

There are a lot of computational environment that had been developed to compute big data, one of them is Hadoop that has Distributed File System and MapReduce framework. Spark is newly framework that can be combined with Hadoop and run on top of it. In this paper, we design intelligent k-means based on Spark for big data clustering. Our design is using batch of data instead using original Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). We compare our design with the implementation that using original RDD of data.

	<dc:abstract>An experiment to study the entropy method for an anomaly detection system has been performed. The study has been conducted using real data generated from the distributed sensor networks at the Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory. The experimental results were compared with the elliptical method and has been analyzed in two dimensional data sets acquired from temperature and humidity sensors across 52 micro controllers. Using the binary classification to determine the upper and lower boundaries for each series of sensors, it has been shown that the entropy method are able to detect more number of out ranging sensor nodes than the elliptical methods. It can be argued that the better result was mainly due to the lack of elliptical approach which is requiring certain correlation between two sensor series, while in the entropy approach each sensor series is treated independently. This is very important in the current case where both sensor series are not correlated each other. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Expertise is specialized skills and knowledge. It can be shared or disseminated if stated explicitly using expertise representation. Since people have multi area/domain expertise, we need multi-domain expertise representation. Someone's expertise can be recognized by his/her publication. In this article we proposed a new expertise representation by utilizing bibliography (publication metadata) and annotating ontology (ontology enrichment). The expertise representation is multi-domain that can be integrated semantically as easy as single-domain ontology.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The precise and quick association of targets is one of the main challenging tasks in the signal processing field of the Multistatic Radar System (MRS). The paper deals with target association techniques based on the computation of the Probability Hypothetic Density (PHD) Function. The Computation time makes solving the PHD a very demanding task. The speedup of a newly developed algorithm depends on vectorization and parallel processing techniques. This paper describes the comparison between the original and parallel version of the target association algorithm with the full set of input data (without any knowledge about the approximation of targets direction) and the comparison with the advanced target association algorithm using additional input information about the direction of the target. All algorithms are processed in the MATLAB environment and Microsoft Visual Studio-C. The comparison also includes Central Processor Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) version of all algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Online discussion forum in mathematics teaching still needs to be investigated in order that educators can facilitate effective students online learning experience. The challenges faced in teaching Linear Algebra at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia are that students are freshmen who are used to being dependent learners; and there is a time restriction to face-to-face interaction, while this course requires high interaction between students and instructor. To enhance communication beyond the classroom, we have implemented a blended-mode in the teaching-learning process (face-to-face and online learning). For the purpose of the study, two types of discussion were utilized: general (class) discussion and focus-group discussion forums. This study used message as the unit of analysis. We found that students tend to exhibit teaching presence more intense in small focus-group discussion than in general forum. It is also interesting to note that the students regulated their cognition more in focus-group forum than in the general one. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a design study of an environment that would provide for resilience, high-availability, reproducibility and reliability of Cloud-based applications. The approach involves the use of a resilient container overlay, which provides tools for tracking and optimizing container placement during the course of a scientific experiment execution. The system is designed to detect failure and current performance bottlenecks and be capable of migrating running containers on the fly to servers more optimal for their execution. This work is in the design phase and therefore in this paper, we outline the proposed architecture of system and identify existing container management and migration tools that can be used in the implementation, where appropriate. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As the fourth most populous country in the world, Indonesia has many challenges in e-Government development because of its many scattered island. The country needs Information and Communication Technology for communication and fast access to information to create good governance and clean government. Grid technology could be a solution for resource sharing and interoperability of e-Government systems. We have proposed the Indonesia e-Government Grid service topology model in which is an adjustment based on the framework of existing e-Government and also the form of government in the country. We have designed and simulated the topology of Indonesian e-Government Grid services based on function group from e-Government application solution map to connect the ministry/agency/department /institution and also based on the province and population in the country. In this paper we simulate and analyze the result of the e-Government services topology based on population using Friedman Test. The results shows that scenario involves three types of routers that are configured hierarchically which consist of leaf routers, edge routers and core routers using Self-Clocked Fair Queuing (SCFQ) scheduling algorithm give the best results. The setting of time delay make the waiting time for packets in Grid simulation queue become shorter. © 2014 SERSC.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In previous studies, it was revealed that the importance of learning styles, motivation, and knowledge ability factors are facilitated diverse learners in e-learning. However, the overall of factors are not yet fully accommodated in e-learning process. Meanwhile, the results of preliminary study of this research indicated that the existence of these factors as the inherent structure that reflect the relationship among learning styles and motivation to the knowledge ability (Triple-Factor) in elearning process. In order to accommodate the existence of inherent structure, this study explores the learning types based on triple-factor in e-learning process. The approach can be used as the basis for the learning recommendation and personalization in e-learning process. The approach consists of three steps: (1) identifying activity and evaluation of learning outcome, (2) forming Triple-Factor, and (3) detecting learning types based on Triple-Factor. The approach use 36 types of learning which consists of: 18 learning types that has the ability of knowledge good or very good, irrespective of the learning styles and motivation; and 18 learning types that has the ability of knowledge fail or sufficient, irrespective of the learning styles and motivation. Furthermore, the experiment for testing steps was carried by dividing two stages: the first stage did not implement the approach, second stage using learning recommendation and personalization. Result of the testing of these two stages are: step of " identifying activity and evaluation of learning outcome " at the second stage, showed that there was a significant increase on the activity of learning (0.007&lt;0.05), and discussion forums (0.006&lt;0.05), meanwhile the evaluation of learning outcomes (0.227&gt;0.05) did not increase significantly. Step of "forming Triple-Factor", and " detecting learning type base on Triple-Factor" at the second stage showed: learning styles and motivation with the knowledge ability of good and very good increased from 57 to 69 students. In contrast learning styles and motivation with the knowledge ability of fail and sufficient decreased from 61 to 49. The results show that the approach used in the study successfully improve the learning process and its outcomes through learning recommendation and personalization.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Breast cancer is one of the leading deadly causes for women. Detection of this disease in the early stages, especially before spreading to other organs, can significantly improve survival patients' rates. Medical decision support systems with intelligent classification systems can give second opinion and help reducing possible error because of inexperienced experts, fatigued or improper time limit medical data examination. Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP ANN) has been extensively used in intelligent breast cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, the standard gradient-based learning algorithm has several drawbacks such as probability to reach local minima, inefficient training time, and too many setting parameters. Recent studies proved that Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), mathematically and experimentally, could solve BP ANN limitations in several problems. In this paper, we implemented best-parameterized ELM for benign and malignant breast cancer detection. Results showed that Sigmoid ELM generally gave the best performances compared to widely used classification methods such as Decision Tree, BP ANN, and other ELM models with 96% accuracy. This method deployment is promising in medical decision support systems as its intelligent component. © (2014) by Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communication (SDIWC).

	<dc:abstract>A novel approach to analyze statistically the network traffic raw data is proposed. The huge amount of raw data of actual network traffic from the Intrusion Detection System is analyzed to determine if a traffic is a normal or harmful one. Using the active ports in each host in a network as sensors, the system continuously monitors the incoming packets, and generates its average behaviors at different time scales including its variances. The average region of behaviors at certain time scale is then being used as the baseline of normal traffic. Deploying the exhaustive search based decission system, the system detects the incoming threats to the whole network under supervision. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A new model for a cluster of hybrid sensors network with multi sub-clusters is proposed. The model is in particular relevant to the early warning system in a large scale monitoring system in, for example, a nuclear power plant. It mainly addresses to a safety critical system which requires real-time processes with high accuracy. The mathematical model is based on the extended conventional search algorithm with certain interactions among the nearest neighborhood of sensors. It is argued that the model could realize a highly accurate decision support system with less number of parameters. A case of one dimensional interaction function is discussed, and a simple algorithm for the model is also given. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The result of our preliminary study indicates that there is an impact triple-factor on learning activities in Student Centered E-Learning Environment (SCELE). It shows that the triple-factor: learning style, motivation and knowledge ability identification needs personalization approach in e-learning. The identification are predicted from log, forum, and score test. In this paper, we propose a dynamic personalization in e-learning process based on triple-factor architecture. The architecture consists of five main layers: learning strategy layer, learning layer, activity layer, identification layer and personalization layer.

	<dc:abstract>This study discusses the design and simulation of an e-learning computer network topology based on Grid computing technology for Indonesian schools called the Indonesian Education Grid (abbreviated as IndoEdu-Grid). The usage of such a grid has its advantages such as supporting the use of heterogeneous resources (hardware or software) and resources sharing. The establishment of such network without Grid computing capabilities will lead to redundancies of the idle resources. The simulation which is built using GridSim toolkit will handle the proposed two conditions or scenarios that have different network topologies based on their routers and links configuration. Each scenario will be run in the simulator using two packet scheduling algorithms, one will be FIFO (First In First Out) Scheduler and the other SCFQ (Self-Clocked Fair Queuing) Scheduler. The processing time of the job's packets will be evaluated to determine the most effective network topology for IndoEdu-Grid. The simulation result showed that if SCFQ scheduling algorithm is used then the most appropriate network topology is the topology which allows its packets with the same priorities to have less possibility to collide one another in one router or link which is the first scenario. The simulation results also showed that SCFQ scheduling algorithm can reduce the packets lifetime at routers that have very crowded traffics. This fact implies to the decrease of the whole job processing time. © Medwell Journals, 2010.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Since the last few years, E-culture - a new term that describes the Information Communication Technology (ICT) roles in humanities has been introduced. E-Culture is an application that applies ICT for culture. Cultural heritage is a material culture or cultural artefact which functions as national or ethnic identity. It also has economic value such as tourism industry. Meanwhile, Culture itself is a complex and dynamically evolving system. A country that has many and heterogeneous ethnic groups-such as Indonesia-needs to manage its cultural artifacts. In this paper, Ethno-Grid which is a grid computing based technology is proposed. It acts as a supporting infrastructure in E-Culture. The architecture of Ethno-Grid consists of some major module services such as those for archaeological, linguistic, and cultural applications.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An inexact Newton method is commonly used to solve large nonlinear systems, arising for instance from simulating models in mathematics, chemistry and physics. In this paper, we propose an implementation of parallelization across the method in solving a nonlinear system, arising from Runge-Kutta method, which is a part of our work on ODE [11]. We also implement parallelization across the system in solving the arising linear system, with the aim of investigating whether this will contribute to speedup to the whole process. We used two kinds of test problems related to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), i.e. Brusselator and Dense problems. The experiment was performed on a cluster of PCs with PVM message passing environment. Our observation shows that for Brusselator problem, using multiprocessors will result in a better performance in terms of speedup for sufficiently large data. For Dense problem, though we expect to have speedup more than two, the maximum attainable speedup is only two. © 2004 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In our previous paper [3], the performance of a variable step-size implementation of Parallel Iterated Methods based on Multistep Runge-Kutta methods (PIMRK) is far from satisfactory. This is due to the fact that the underlying parameters of the Multistep Runge-Kutta (MRK) method, and the splitting matrices W that are needed to solve the nonlinear system are designed on a fixed step-size basis. Similar unsatisfactory results based on this method were also noted by Schneider [12], who showed that the method is only suitable when the step-size does not vary too often. In this paper, we design the Variable step-size Multistep Runge-Kutta (VMRK) method as the underlying formula for Parallel Iterated methods. The numerical results show that Parallel Iterated Variable step-size MRK (PIVMRK) methods improve substantially on the PIMRK methods and are usually competitive with Parallel Iterated Runge-Kutta methods (PIRKs). © J.C.

	<dc:abstract>This paper investigates iterated Multistep Runge-Kutta methods of Radau type as a class of explicit methods suitable for parallel implementation. Using the idea of van der Houwen and Sommeijer [18], the method is designed in such a way that the right-hand side evaluations can be computed in parallel. We use stepsize control and variable order based on iterated approximation of the solution. A code is developed and its performance is compared with codes based on iterated Runge-Kutta methods of Gauss type and various Dormand and Prince pairs [15]. The accuracy of some of our methods are comparable with the PIRK10 methods of van der Houwen and Sommeijer [18], but require fewer processors. In addition at very stringent tolerances these new methods are competitive with RK78 pairs in a sequential implementation.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many authors have worked on approaches for solving Initial Value Problems (IVPs) in Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) whose solutions contain one or more singular points within the interval of integration. Their approaches, however, assumed that the user knows in advance that the problem is singular. Hence they introduced new formulas to cope with this difficulty. In this paper, a new approach to detect and locate a singularity is suggested. This approach, which does not require the changing of the underlying formula, is comprised of two stages. The first is a preliminary singularity detection stage. The second stage is the confirmation stage which gathers more information about the existence and location of the singular point. We justify the first state and introduce three different techniques for confirming the existence of a singularity. The numerical results show that our approach is effective. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Customer Knowledge Management (CKM) has been widely accepted by enterprises as an effective tool to struggle in competitive era. Studies have explored various CKM models to maximize its benefits to organization. This diversity can be valuable, because it offers many point of views about CKM. However, enterprises should consider the best CKM model to suit their needs. With the various CKM models, it just confuses the enterprises. Therefore, this paper proposes a more structured concept of CKM goals and key factors. Theoretically, it gives a high-level scheme to academia in developing and improving future CKM model. In practice, this research can be used by enterprises to implement an effective CKM by considering the key factors. Using Kitchenham method, this research has discovered 105 papers and selected 20 papers based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic analysis was deductively applied to examine the qualitative data. The findings classified CKM goals into four categories i.e organization, product and service, customer, and process. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-government facilitates the use of Information Technology to establish government public services. A common feature of e-government is a Website as public portal. One of prominent institutions in Indonesia, which is obliged to provide the Website is the Central Bureau of Statistics. However, a data requirement survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics in 2017 indicated a gap between user expectation and user satisfaction of the Website. Besides, an assessment by the Open Data Inventory (ODIN) indicated that the Website has not met the international Website quality criteria, especially data completeness and data openness measures. To address this problem, a research was conducted to investigate its shortcomings and propose strategies for improvement. The data were collected using questionnaires, which were grouped into the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) matric quadrants. It was followed by literature studies and interviews with experts in statistical Website to propose improvement strategies. The priority of strategies was compiled using the Quality Functional Deployment (QFD). The results show that the Central Bureau of Statistics are required to optimize the Website code, redesign the Website layout, create statistical data forum, conduct statistical capacity building, and improve the data interoperability. Lesson learned from this research and its findings are potential to be adopted in other emerging economies, which strive to provide qualified data on e-government Websites to their citizens. © 2019 IADIS Press.

	<dc:abstract>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a graphical representation and notation for modeling complex business processes in diagrams. A simple BPMN diagram is easier to understand by all of the business stakeholders than a complex one. It is also easier for the developers to implement the corresponding systems. Complexity metrics can measure the complexity of a diagram. Only a few BPMN complexity metrics are found in the literature as BPMN is a recent development. To propose a new BPMN complexity metric, it is important to find suitable software complexity metrics which can be further adapted to develop a complexity metric for BPMN. This research surveys the existing software complexity metrics and the existing BPMN complexity metrics (i.e. McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity, Control-flow Complexity, and Halstead-based Process Complexity Metrics) to compare their performance and suitability in measuring the complexity of BPMN diagrams. The BPMN diagrams of the business processes of two Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) open-source systems (i.e. Compiere and Openbravo ERP systems) are used in this research. The metrics values obtained are compared with empirical application and code measurement values (i.e. number of form-fields, number of files of code, and number of classes) of the two open-source systems. This research finds that the Halstead-based Process Complexity that has been proposed in the literature is useful in measuring the data complexity of BPMN diagrams. This means that the Halstead-based Process Complexity can be further elaborated to produce a BPMN complexity measure. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A new system of Automatic Vehicle Classification (AVC) has been verified by means of a reverse engineering approach using Behavior Tree (BT). This approach was inspired by accuracy problem possessed by the AVC system as well as the benefits offered by BT. Although the AVC system has been deployed, it performs several failures in classifying vehicles with certain behavior under specific environment. It was due to specific requirements that had been overlooked by conventional textual-narrative requirement expressions. A formal but simpler and more natural way of requirement expression in Behavior Tree is expected to eliminate the weakness of conventional requirement representation. Results of the case study are BT representation of the AVC system and several test case specifications using Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) notations. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Developing NER system using machine learning approach needs a big dataset which is costly if the dataset labeling is done manually. The previous works proposed methods in tagging automatically the Indonesian NER dataset using Wikipedia articles as the source of the dataset and DBpedia as the reference of the entity type. However, the quality of the resulting dataset was still inadequate. A method named DBpedia Entities Expansion (DEE) had introduced several rules to expand named entities in DBpedia in order to improve recall, but it had not managed to remove noise that makes precision decline, especially for person names. The objective of this research is to propose the modification to DEE method with the main focus to remove invalid names from the list of person names in the Expanded DBpedia. We call this modification as Modified DEE (M-DEE). The evaluation shows that M-DEE can improve the precision for person names around 3% compared to the original DEE. By adding gazetteers for place and organization names into the Expanded DBpedia created by M-DEE, the margin about 10% of the overall F1-score for all types was achieved. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The objective of our work is to detect hate speech in the Indonesian language. As far as we know, the research on this subject is still very rare. The only research we found has created a dataset for hate speech against religion, but the quality of this dataset is inadequate. Our research aimed to create a new dataset that covers hate speech in general, including hatred for religion, race, ethnicity, and gender. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary study using machine learning approach. Machine learning so far is the most frequently used approach in classifying text. We compared the performance of several features and machine learning algorithms for hate speech detection. Features that extracted were word n-gram with n=l and n=2, character n-gram with n=3 and n=4, and negative sentiment. The classification was performed using Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Decision Tree. An F-measure of 93.5% was achieved when using word n-gram feature with Random Forest Decision Tree algorithm. Results also show that word n-gram feature outperformed character n-gram. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>DBpedia entities expansion in automatically building dataset for Indonesian NER</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a significant role in Information Extraction (IE). In English, the NER systems have achieved excellent performance, but for the Indonesian language, the systems still need a lot of improvement. To create a reliable NER system using machine learning approach, a massive dataset to train the classifier is a must. Several studies have proposed methods in automatically building dataset for Indonesian NER using Indonesian Wikipedia articles as the source of the dataset and DBpedia as the reference in determining entity types automatically. The objective of our research is to improve the quality of the automatically tagged dataset. We proposed a new method in using DBpedia as the referenced named entities. We have created some rules in expanding DBpedia entities corpus for category person, place, and organization. The resulting training dataset is trained using Stanford NER tool to build an Indonesian NER classifier. The evaluation shows that our method improves recall significantly but has lower precision compared to the previous research. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Airline industries utilize e-commerce website as one way to offer services. The website creates a new area of competition between the airlines, i.e. comparative qualities among their e-commerce websites. This research aims to develop a framework which can be used to evaluate the quality of airline's e-commerce website. Furthermore, this research also compares the quality of e-commerce website between AirAsia and Lion Air. The evaluation is based on five quality aspects, i.e. information quality, service interaction quality, usability, website design and playfulness/enjoyment.

	<dc:abstract>The hate speech has become the major source of negativity spread in all over the social media. As the social media becomes aware of this issue, they gradually build several new regulations to handle the spread of hate speech e.g. by automatically blocking or suspending the accounts or posts containing hate speech. However, the social media users have become more creative in expressing the hate speech. To avoid the social media regulations regarding the hate speech, users usually use some special codes to interact with each other. This study aims to utilize the hate codes to identify the hate speech on the social media data. We used the Indonesian tweets as the dataset. We utilized Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest Decision Tree as the classifiers. The highest F-Measure score for the hate speech identification was 80.71% by using the hate code feature combined with Logistic Regression as the classifier. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Due to the growth of hate speech on social media in recent years, it is important to understand this issue. An automatic hate speech detection system is needed to help to counter this problem. There have been many studies on detecting hate speech in short documents like Twitter data. But to our knowledge, research on long documents is rare, we suppose that the difficulty is increasing due to the possibility of the message of the text may be hidden. In this research, we explore in detecting hate speech on Indonesian long documents using machine learning approach. We build a new Indonesian hate speech dataset from Facebook. The experiment showed that the best performance obtained by Support Vector Machine (SVM) as its classifier algorithm using TF-IDF, char quad-gram, word unigram, and lexicon features that yield f1-score of 85%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia has a huge number of Twitter users and a lot of them often communicate using abusive language. Not only in the context of jokes, many Indonesian netizens often use abusive language to curse (offense) someone. Research about abusive language detection in Indonesian Twitter has been done using classical machine learning approach. However, the performance was still not too good, especially in differentiating whether the tweet is an abusive but not offensive or an offensive language. This paper implements a deep learning approach to enhance the performance when identifying abusive but not offensive or an offensive language. We use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with word embedding because our literature study found that LSTM with word embedding is good for text classification (both for English or Indonesian text classification). The experiment result shows that LSTM with word embedding can increase the F1-Score from the previous work until 19.44%, from 70.06% to 83.68%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recording of law enforcement needs to measure the extent to what the enforcement law has been carried out in accordance with applicable legal rules. This law enforcement record can be obtained by collecting, analyzing and concluding various legal cases from court decision documents. The number of court decision documents is vast and continues to grow at any time; it requires an extraction process of information that can be run automatically. The conditions of court decision documents that have different use of sentences and the use of word variations are challenges in the process of information extraction. This research proposed rule-based information extraction for court decision documents to exploring and developing the recording of law enforcement in Indonesia. The process uses three steps, identifying structure extraction, tokenization and extracting entities. This research use 150 court decision documents dataset and the experiment has produced 0.82, 0.96, 0.89, beside of average recall, precision, and f-score. This shows that rule-based information extraction can be implemented in the legal domain and supports the development of law enforcement records in Indonesia. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The growth of mobile e-commerce and the popularity of smartphones makes the intensity of mobile app users increase exponentially. The users can provide reviews related to their experience while using the application, this review can contain valuable information such as complaints or suggestions that can be used for further in-depth analysis based on reviews given. However, the large number of reviews makes it difficult to find and understand the information contained in each review. To solve these problems, this study proposes a model that can extract information in the reviews by categorizing and analyzing sentiments in each review using the text mining approach and machine learning techniques, we use several algorithms for sentiment analysis, classification and modeling topics that are popularly used by previous researchers. The output of this model is a collection of the most trending reviews that have been identified and classified as polarity sentiments and review categories. We had conducted a series of experiments to find the best model, the average sentiment precision of reviews is 85% and the best algorithm for classifying the reviews obtained using SVM with an average FI score of 84.38% using the unigram feature while the NMF works better compared to LDA in modeling topic reviews. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays social media is often misused to spread hate speech. Spreading hate speech is an act that needs to be handled in a special way because it can undermine or discriminate other people and cause conflict that leading to both material and immaterial losses. There are several challenges in building a hate speech identification system; one of them is identifying hate speech in multilingual scope. In this paper, we adapt and compare two methods in multilingual text classification which are translated (with and without language identification) and non-translated method for multilingual hate speech identification (including Hindi, English, and Indonesian language) using machine learning approach. We use some classification algorithms (classifiers) namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest Decision Tree (RFDT) with word n-grams and char n-grams (character n-grams) as feature extraction. Our experiment result shows that the non-translated method gives the best result. However, the use of non-translated method needs to be reconsidered because this method needs more cost for data collection and annotation. Meanwhile, translated without language identification method give a poor result. To address this problem, we combine translated method with monolingual hate speech identification, and the experiment result shows that this approach can increase the multilingual hate speech identification performance compared to translate without language identification. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages for all method and the future works to enhance the performance in multilingual hate speech identification. © 2019, Insight Society.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The implementation of e-government in Indonesia is still far from the expectations and target of Presidential Instruction No. 3 of 2003 on 'E-Government policy'. Based on the UN assessment shows that the index of e-participation in Indonesia is below the world average. Increasing e-participation index may use social media. The rapidly growing of social media makes many countries have engagement with their citizens, thereby facilitating participatory decision making. In this study, we analyze Indonesia government ministries practices and calculate the engagement rate of each ministry of Instagram, a social media for image sharing. We use a year of Instagram data were posted from 1 January 2016 till 31 December 2016. The results indicate that Ministries tend to share their posts during the weekday and working hour. People tend to endorse photos with many likes and comments. The results of analysis of ministry Instagram data revealed that the engagement level of the people does not correlate with the frequency of Instagram ministries post. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Analysis of early cancer prognosis is necessary to determine the proper treatment for each patient. Furthermore, as microarray DNA has high dimensional data it would lead to a challenging task. Several studies in high dimensionality reduction have been conducted to determine significant genes with least error in cancer classification. One of those studies implements mining process such as feature selection using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Other than feature selection, data integration is also believed as an optimal solution in increasing cancer classification performance. In this paper, dataset containing gene expression value and clinical parameters observed from 60 breast cancer patients is used for experiment. The experiment consists of integrating data using early kernel based data integration model with modification in its dimensionality reduction step. In the existing related research, kernel dimensionality reduction is used. In this paper, mining process using several parametric and non-parametric based statistical tests is used as the replacement of kernel dimensionality reduction. The last step in kernel based data integration is classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Ten-fold cross validation scheme is used in the experiment. SVM with linear kernel gives the best accuracy rate compared to other kernels. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents an implementation of hate speech identification task for text data written in Indonesian language. There are some studies purposed for similar problem, but all of them use classical machine learning approach, whose heavily depends on the feature engineering. Switching the domain of data set means that the feature engineering should be redone. To address this issue, this preliminary research proposes another method based on deep learning approach which needs no feature engineering and is also adaptive to the varying context. Using data sets sourced from Twitter posts, the proposed method gives better result of 94.5% F1-score at a minimum. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Public Sentiment on Political Campaign Using Twitter Data in 2017 Jakarta's Governor Election</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>The campaign period is the time when candidates introduce themselves to the public and socialize their vision and mission. Some media, including social media, can be used as a medium for campaigning. To know the public view of political campaigns can use sentiment analysis using Twitter data. This research analyzes public sentiment toward the political campaign for candidate pair of a governor and vice governor of DKI Jakarta in 2017. We use sentiStrength, a program using the lexicon-based approach as a classification method. We classify each tweet into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral classes. The results show that, in general, positive sentiments dominates negative sentiments for each candidate for governor and vice governor. The results also show that the positive sentiments of all pairs have the same sequence as the election results. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Pangkajene and Kepulauan (Pangkep) District is an area located in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Regional Civil Servants, Education, and Training (BKPPD) responsible for managing the civil servants (PNS) of Pangkep District. BKPPD provides mutation services to civil servants ranging from recruitment, placement, transfer, education and training, discipline, dismissal, and retirement. Currently, BKPPD has difficulty in conducting mutations, determining which civil servants should be transferred because the absence of a reference mutation pattern. This study aims to obtain mutation patterns using data mining based on historical data on the employment service application system (SAPK). We use three classification algorithms, which are Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for revealing the mutation pattern in the mutation history data. We find that the decision tree yields the highest accuracy compared to Naive Bayes and SVM with a value of 72.76%. This research also recommends that the mutation pattern may be implemented by BKPPD to design the civil servants redistribution planning of Pangkep District Government. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The number of user reviews for a mobile app can reach thousands so it will take a lot of time for app developers to sort through and find information that is important for further app development. Therefore, this study aims to automatically classify mobile application user reviews. Automatic classification conducted in this study is using machine learning approach. The features extracted from user review are unigram, bigram, star rating, review length, as well as the ratio of the number of words with positive and negative sentiment. For classification algorithms, we used Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. The experiment result shows that Logistic Regression gives the best F-Measure of 85% when combined with unigram plus sentence length and sentiment score. Unigram was proven as the most important feature since the additional features like sentence length and sentiment score only increased the F-measure around 1%. Bigram and star rating has negative impact on the classifier performance. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Internet has many benefits, some of them are to gain knowledge and gain the latest information. The internet can be used by anyone and can contain any information, including negative content such as pornographic content, radicalism, racial intolerance, violence, fraud, gambling, security and drugs. Those contents cause the number of children victims of pornography on social media increasing every year. Based on that, it needs a system that detects pornographic content on social media. This study aims to determine the best model to detect the pornographic content. Model selection is determined based on unigram and bigram features, classification algorithm, k-fold cross validation. The classification algorithm used is Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes. The highest F1-score is yielded by the model with combination of Support Vector Machine, most common words, and combination of unigram and bigram, which returns F1-Score value of 91.14%. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>It can be difficult for ordinary people to understand reading the Indonesian Law (Undang-Undang) documents since they are usually extensive and specific language style usage which contains many law terms, especially in finding the punishment provision part. To address this problem, we propose a system to extract punishment provision information from Indonesian Law document. It uses Ripple Down Rule Learner (Ridor) to find articles, verses, or points which have punishment consequences. It may also obtain the punishment provision information and present them in structured format. Experiment shows that the proposed system can reach 93.9% Fl-Score. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cryptocurrency trade is now a popular type of investment. Cryptocurrency market has been treated similar to foreign exchange and stock market. However, because of its volatility, there's a need for a prediction tool for investors to help them consider investment decisions for cryptocurrency trade. Nowadays, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computing based tools are commonly used in stock and foreign exchange market predictions. There has been much research about ANN predictor on stocks and foreign exchange as case studies but none on cryptocurrency. Therefore, this research studied variety of ANN method to predict the market value of one of the most used cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The ANN methods will be used to develop model to predict the close value of Bitcoin in the next day (next day prediction). This study compares four ANN methods, namely backpropagation neural network (BPNN), genetic algorithm neural network (GANN), genetic algorithm backpropagation neural network (GABPNN), and neuro-evolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT). The methods are evaluated based on accuracy and complexity. The result of the experiment showed that BPNN is the best method with MAPE 1.998 ± 0.038 % and training time 347 ± 63 seconds. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Collaborative filtering has been used extensively in the commercial recommender system because of its effectiveness and ease of implementation. Collaborative filtering predicts a user's preference based on preferences of similar users or from similar items to items that are purchased by this user. The use of either user-based or item-based similarity is not sufficient. For that particular issues, hybridization of user-based and item-based in one collaborative filtering recommender system can be used to sort relevant item out of a set of candidates. This method applies similarity measures using link prediction to predict target item by combining user similarity with item similarity. The experiment results show that the combination of user and item similarities in two-steps collaborative filtering setting improves accuracy compared to the algorithm applying only user or item similarity. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge is one of the most valuable assets for an organization. By managing existing knowledge, organizations can gain competitive advantage in competition with other organizations. Otherwise, if the existing knowledge within the organization is not properly managed, it can lead to losses such as loss of business opportunities, and the destruction of the organization due to lack of innovation so that knowledge management is required. In practice, knowledge management is not always successfully implemented by every organization. To be able to reduce the risk of failure in the effort of knowledge management, assessment of knowledge management readiness implementation is required in the organization. The purpose of this research is to know the readiness of knowledge management implementation and its factors that can be improved in the IT Service company. Aspects used in this research are Organization Culture, Organization Structure, IT Infrastructure, Individual Acceptance and Intention to be involved in KM Process. The methodology used in this study used a survey approach on 103 respondents with reliability and validity test in data processing and assessment of readiness and PLS for factor analysis. This research concludes that the company has reached level 4 or receptive readiness level.

	<dc:abstract>Rumor spreading has been an essential issue for society. One of the platforms for rumor spreading is Twitter. Finding the opinion leader of its issue is also important in order to know who are users whom have a high impact of bringing the issue. So we can give the suggestion to the law authority to give the right authorization afterward. Opinion leader can be found using centrality measure metric on social network analysis study. This study has node and edge as its property. For recent years, there are many conducted researches about centrality measure. Some of them are combining some centrality measures together. Aside from defining the centrality measure, defining the edge is also important. Twitter has a different kind of relationships that can be turned into an edge, but not all the relationships have the same impact for spreading the rumor. This study conduct two experiments, first experiment is edge weighting. This experiment is aimed to see the importance of each defined edge type for finding the opinion leader. The second experiment is centrality weighting. This experiment is aimed to see the weight that could give more accurate opinion leader based on other evaluation algorithms. The study found the edge that has the ability to spread to wider audience (quote, retweet, and reply) tend to have a bigger impact for finding opinion leader than mention relationship. The study also finds that a low in-degree weight, high betweenness weight, and low or no PageRank weight could give 100% agreement upon other evaluation algorithms for finding the opinion leader. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Abusive language is an expression (both oral or text) that contains abusive/dirty words or phrases both in the context of jokes, a vulgar sex conservation or to cursing someone. Nowadays many people on the internet (netizens) write and post an abusive language in the social media such as Facebook, Line, Twitter, etc. Detecting an abusive language in social media is a difficult problem to resolve because this problem can not be resolved just use word matching. This paper discusses a preliminaries study for abusive language detection in Indonesian social media and the challenge in developing a system for Indonesian abusive language detection, especially in social media. We also built reported an experiment for abusive language detection on Indonesian tweet using machine learning approach with a simple word n-gram and char n-gram features. We use Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Decision Tree classifier to identify the tweet whether the tweet is a not abusive language, abusive but not offensive, or offensive language. The experiment results show that the Naive Bayes classifier with the combination of word unigram + bigrams features gives the best result i.e. 70.06% of F1 - Score. However, if we classifying the tweet into two labels only (not abusive language and abusive language), all classifier that we used gives a higher result (more than 83% of F1 - Score for every classifier).

	<dc:abstract>Emoji is a picture character used in social media to express emotion of a text message. With the increasing use of emoji few who study the relationship between emoji and text. Due to diversity of emoji and the similarity meaning between emoji, emoji classification task is more relative complex than common text classification task. In this paper, we build a computational model by extracted various features namely: linguistic feature, semantic feature, and lexicon feature to improve emoji classification performance. Then we train 400k tweet using two different classifiers Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier and Logistic Regression. The experiment showed that our proposed feature using Logistic Regression outperformed the baseline. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>To guide the research directions among research institutes in Indonesia, a National Research Agenda is periodically formulated. The list of prospective research areas in this document is usually determined by the judgement of experts whose opinions could be subjective. Meanwhile, a more objective approach has been studied by several researchers to find the emerging research areas by tracking the frequency of scientific publications. This paper investigates the use of this bibliometric approach to identify and forecast the emerging research areas listed in the Indonesian National Research Agenda. Diverse forecast methods are employed and selected based on their performance on previous dataset. In this way, there is no need for training on the current dataset which may reduce time to select the best method. The dataset is compiled from Scopus search engine by querying the research area in question. To construct the historical database, we use the dataset from M1 competition and the testing dataset from NN3 competition as well as time series constructed from query on Scopus. Our experimental results indicate that our model selection may perform well compared to the individual predictor. In addition, the most emerging research topics based on the forecast results can be quantitatively identified. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Product attribute extraction is an important task in e-commerce domain. Extracting pairs of attribute label and value from free-text product descriptions can be useful for many tasks, such as product matching, product categorization, faceted product search, and product recommendation. In this paper, we present a study of attribute extraction from Indonesian e-commerce product titles. We annotate 1,721 product titles with 16 attribute labels. We apply supervised learning technique using CRF algorithm. We propose combination of lexical, word embedding, and dictionary features to learn the attribute using joint extraction model. Our model achieves F1-measure 47.30% and 68.49% respectively for full match and partial match evaluation. Based on the experiment, we find that doing attributes extraction on more various number and diverse attributes simultaneously does not necessarily give worse result compared to extraction on less number of attributes. © 2018 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

	<dc:abstract>GO-JEK and Grab are two most popular online transportation service providers in Indonesia. The competition between the two is tight to acquire new customers and provide the best service. No official survey has been conducted in measuring customer satisfaction at both companies to give insight which company offers better service quality. This study aims to measure GO-JEK and Grab customer satisfaction through sentiment analysis of Twitter's data. Both companies use Twitter to reach their customers and promote their service. We collect 126,405 tweets from February to March 2016 containing GO-JEK and Grab keywords. Then, we pre-process the tweets and label manually before they are classified using three algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree. We made and compared several classification schemes with different keywords, dataset, and k-fold cross validation techniques. Finally, we calculate Net Sentiment Score which correlates with customer satisfaction using classification results. The experiments shows that Grab's customer satisfaction is higher than GO-JEK's. The study also shows that customers tend to mention both companies Twitter account for bad experiences and not mentioning company's account for positive comments. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>A comparative analysis of memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering on the implementation of recommender system for E-commerce in Indonesia: A case study PT X</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>The increasing growth of e-commerce industry in Indonesia motivates e-commerce sites to provide better services to its customer. One of the strategies to improves e-commerce services is by providing personal recommendation, which can be done using recommender systems. However, there is still lack of studies exploring the best technique to implement recommender systems for e-commerce in Indonesia. This study compares the performance of two implementation approaches of collaborative filtering, which are memory-based and model-based, using data sample of PT X e-commerce. The performance of each approach was evaluated using offline testing and user-based testing. The result of this study indicates that the model-based recommender system is better than memory-based recommender system in three aspects: a) the accuracy of recommendation, b) computation time, and c) the relevance of recommendation. For number of transaction less than 300,000 in database, respondents perceived that the computation time of memory-based recommender system is tolerable, even though the computational time is longer than model-based. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, e-government implementation in Indonesia does not meet the objectives of presidential regulation on "E-government Policy". Based on the report of the United Nations in 2014, Indonesia obtained 0.4487 out of 1 for e-government and 0.2941 out of 1 for e-participation. Social media is a good way to increase e-government and e-participation because it is inexpensive, easy to implement and has been implemented by several nations that have high e-government and e-participation index. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the phenomenon of social media used by government agencies in Indonesia, particularly messages posted in Twitter. The messages are analysed based on content, tone, source, source type, forms, and response. The result showed that Corruption Eradication Commission obtains the highest index of twitter use (9.031 out of 100) among other agencies. This number indicates that the use of Twitter by government agencies in Indonesia are not optimal. © 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the considered business opportunities that exploit the geographical aspect is the branch office expansion. However, this activity still has some problems to learn various location criteria, either in quantitative or qualitative form. Moreover, there is a need to analyze those criteria quickly to get a proper location priority that will be expanded. Therefore, this research develops a semantic technology of the form geospatial dashboard using analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) method that can display the distribution of location and its criteria in a map. Furthermore, it recommends the list of top priority locations will be expanded implicitly from the various kinds of data. This research takes a case study in one local company in Indonesia. At the end, this research shows that geospatial dashboard using AHP method is considered capable of producing accurate solution up to 90.48% to determine the priority order of locations to be expanded.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We may see competition among mobile providers to acquire new customers through campaign and advertisement war, especially on social media. The problem arises on how to measure the brand reputation of these providers based on people response on their services quality. This paper addresses this issue by measuring brand reputation based on customer satisfaction through customer's sentiment analysis from Twitter data. Sample model is built and extracted from 10.000 raw Twitter messages data from January to March 2015 of top three mobile providers in Indonesia. We compared several features extractions, algorithms, and the classification schemes. After data cleaning and data balancing, the sentiments are classified and compared using three different algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree classifier method. We measure customer satisfaction on five products: 3G, 4G, Short Messaging, Voice and Internet services. This paper also discusses some correlated business insights in a telecommunication services industry. Based on the overall comparison of these five products, the NBR scores for PT XL Axiata Tbk, PT Telkomsel Tbk, and PT Indosat Tbk are 32.3%, 19.0%, and 10.9% respectively. © 2015 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cultural heritage objects can be found everywhere, whether in heritage institutions (i.e. Library, Archive and Museum) or other sources. Since the cultural heritage has outstanding values to mankind, it is important for us to preserve and benefited its values. The challenging task is that the heritage collection is provided in digital format; have different type of media (i.e. text, image, video, audio and animation); and stored in scattered locations. This paper introduces ontology-based approach in management and retrieval cultural heritage multimedia collection. The goal is to enable the integration of different type of heritage media and to retrieve relevant heritage media to a given query in any type of media. In order to do this, the cultural heritage ontology is developed based on the World Heritage Classification provided by UNESCO/WHC. The ontology also included media classification to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of multimedia collection. The retrieval task is done using SPARQL query language. The result shows that all type of relevant heritage media can be retrieved and the number of retrieved non-relevant media is relatively low. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Selecting the most appropriate forecasting model for certain time series may utilize the similarity between time series. Previous literature defined several global characteristics of time series as similarity measure. This paper attempts to enhance those characteristics by the coefficients of polynomial function. Considering that not all features may be useful for categorization, we employ feature selection to choose the most discriminating features. In addition, we select a forecasting method based on its previous performance on similar dataset. Hence, there is no need to train the current dataset against all predictors. The pool of predictors ranges from simple to sophisticated ones, namely polynomial interpolation, automatic ARIMA, and Multiple Kernel Learning. The dataset used for experiment is the 3003 records from M3 competition to construct the historical database and 111 records from the M1 competition as testing dataset. Our experimental results indicate that our feature enhancement for model selection may improve the forecasting performance. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes the design of question answering system that participates in the maintask of QA4MRE at CLEF 2013. This system will ini-tially perform preprocessing stage of the document and the documents related questions. Then, it identifies the type of questions in order to be able to search the answers with the most appropriate approach. In order to finding the an-swers, the system uses eight heuristics features and two query expansion tech-niques, namely Pseudo Relevance feedback and WordNet as the lexical data-base. There are nine types of runs were submitted at CLEF 2013, where the dif-ference lies in the combination of query expansion techniques and features used. Evaluation will be based on the c@1 measure. Best results are obtained when it uses both query expansion techniques and all features with certain weights.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) is one of recent approaches to choose suitable kernels from a given pool of kernels by exploring the combinations of multiple kernels. For linear kernel, the target kernel is a linear combination some base kernels. However, some literatures suggest that a linear combination of kernels cannot consistently outperform either the uniform combination of base kernels or simply the best single kernel. Hence, some researchers attempt to study the non-linear combination of kernels, such as polynomial combination of kernels or two-layer MKL. This paper extends the previous work on two-layer MKL into three-layer MKL especially in the field of regression to forecast future values of time series. Our experiment on several time series dataset demonstrates that our proposed method generally outperforms the linear combination of kernels. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Analysis of technological trends and developments has been attempted in a number of previous publications using a quantitative method to measure the growth of science. Previous studies on this subject, however, put more emphasis on the frequency either to categorize the technological classes or to find the most prominent technology for a given period of time but less analysis on the future trends. This paper presents the time series analysis of the technological trends while employing the Latent Semantic Analysis to associate each technological term. In current study, we are interested on analyzing the correlation among different trends of terms in the area of biomedical technology to deal with Apnea sleep disorder (difficulty in breathing during sleep). We assume that the study will also applicable to the other areas of research. The technological terms within the concept having the highest trend identified in our experiment are the movement disorders, cystic fibrosis, dental prosthesis, microvascular angina, and esophageal sphincter. Performance evaluation during the experiment indicates that the Support Vector Regression outperform the other techniques, while statistical techniques such as Holt's and Winter's yield above average performance and comparable to the Polynomial method. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Model selection for time series forecasting using similarity measure</dc:title>
	<dc:type>Conference Paper</dc:type>
	<dc:abstract>Several methods have been proposed to combine the forecasting results into single forecast namely the simple averaging, weighted average on validation performance, or non-parametric combination schemas. These methods use fixed combination of individual forecast to get the final forecast result. In this paper, quite different approach is employed to select the forecasting methods, in which every point to forecast is calculated by using the best methods used by similar training dataset. Thus, the selected methods may differ at each point to forecast. The similarity measures used in this paper are Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The dataset used in the experiment is the time series data designated for NN3 Competition. The experimental result shows that the combination of methods selected based on the similarity between training and testing data may perform better compared to either the best of individual predictor or the combination of all methods. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Improving the accuracy of prediction on future values based on the past and current observations has been pursued by enhancing the prediction's methods, combining those methods or performing data pre-processing. In this paper, another approach is taken, namely by increasing the number of input in the dataset. This approach would be useful especially for a shorter time series data. By filling the in-between values in the time series, the number of training set can be increased, thus increasing the generalization capability of the predictor. The algorithm used to make prediction is Neural Network as it is widely used in literature for time series tasks. For comparison, Support Vector Regression is also employed. The dataset used in the experiment is the frequency of USPTO's patents and PubMed's scientific publications on the field of health, namely on Apnea, Arrhythmia, and Sleep Stages. Another time series data designated for NN3 Competition in the field of transportation is also used for benchmarking. The experimental result shows that the prediction performance can be significantly increased by filling in-between data in the time series. Furthermore, the use of detrend and deseasonalization which separates the data into trend, seasonal and stationary time series also improve the prediction performance both on original and filled dataset. The optimal number of increase on the dataset in this experiment is about five times of the length of original dataset. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Forecast combination, which is a method to combine the result of several predictors, offers a way to improve the forecast result. Several methods have been proposed to combine the forecasting results into single forecast, namely the simple averaging, weighted average on validation performance, or non-parametric combination schemas. Recent literature uses dimensional reduction method for individual prediction and employs ordinary least squares for forecast combination. Other literature combines prediction results from neural networks using dimensional reduction techniques. Thus, those previous combination schemas can be categorized into linear combination methods. This paper aims to explore the use of non-linear combination method to perform the ensemble of individual predictors. We believe that the non-linear combination method may capture the non linear relationship among predictors, thus, may enhance the result of final prediction. The Neural Network (NN), which is widely used in literature for time series tasks, is used to perform such combination. The dataset used in the experiment is the time series data designated for NN5 Competition. The experimental result shows that forecast combination using NN performs better than the best individual predictors, provided that the predictors selected for combination have fairly good performance. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The current classification of patent data that refers to the IPC (International Patent Classification) of the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization), deemed not reflect the classification of the field of ICT (Information &amp; Communication Technology). ICT applications are usually included in sections G (Physics) and H (Electricity). This paper will evaluate the eight groupings of patents based on the IPC classes (G01, G06, G09, G11, H01, H03, H04, and H06) of patents registered in the Directorate General of Intellectual Property Rights in Indonesia, from the year 1991 to 2000. The algorithm used to grouping is KMeans, KMeans, Hierchical Clustering, and a combination of these three algorithms with SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). For external validation, Purity and F-Measure are used, whereas Silhouette is used for internal validation. From the experimental results it can be concluded that SVD provides improvements to the clustering results. In addition, the use of abstract does not necessarily improve the performance of clustering, and the use of phrase does not always yield better cluster than the use of the word as index. Moreover, no cluster has purity measure greater than 50%, which means that the existing IPC classification has not been able to accommodate the field of ICT appropriately. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

In this work we translated an Indonesian query set into English using a machine translation tool available on the internet. Documents relevant to a question are first retrieved. The relevant documents are then divided into passages of 5 sentences each. The answer to the question is extracted from a passage relevant to the query. The answer is identified based on matching annotations between the query and the documents. A linguistic tool is used to annotate the words in the queries and the documents.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The challenge faced in teaching Linear Algebra at the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia is students are forced to accommodate their past understanding about vector with the new knowledge. Our past experiences show that self-monitoring and knowledge-sharing with other students are two effective strategies for enabling students' accommodation process. An approach proposed in the current study will apply intervention in a form of instructional method into Linear Algebra course facilitated with online collaborative and self-monitoring tools. Online collaborative tool used in the course is a discussion forum at a Moodle-based learning management system customized and maintained by the faculty. Self-regulated learning is used as framework and experimental research design is used to measure intervention effects on students' learning performance. The study will also use a metacognition questionnaire to analyze online forum discussion capturing students' self- and co-regulation. In addition to that, a correlation test will be conducted to investigate connections between self- and co-regulation with students' learning outcome. The preliminary findings show positive relationship with accommodation process. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-Learning has become the solution to overcome the barriers of time and place in conventional learning. However, the conventional e-Learning faces the lack of user engagement to the system, making the interaction within the system not optimal. Gamification concept can be used to diminish less engagement of the participants. Gamified e-Learning provides new way of learning by raising the student's motivation and engagement to the e-Learning system using game elements. This paper aims to propose the gamified e-Learning model based on the Community of Inquiry (Col) model. The gamified e-Learning model in this paper is based on the experiment that compare the learning process within two weeks of simulation using gamified e-Learning system and non-gamified system. This experiment which conducted to high school students in Indonesia shows positive impact of the proposed model. The interviews with the respondent are also held to support the finding. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Effective e-Learning requires students to be active, thus, creating an environment that engages the students is one of the challenges. One of the ways to build an engaging e-Learning environment is by applying gamification concept. It improves user engagement by enriching the system with the game design elements. This research aims to analyze the impact of gamification environment on e-Learning system by looking at student's quantitative interaction. 38 students from different high schools were voluntarily joined to test out two different system. This experiment focus on observing the impact of removing and adding gamification on the existing e-Learning system. The result shows that removing gamification causes significant decrement on student participation while adding gamification had no significant impact. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Online social media are growing very rapidly in recent years, such as Twitter. Even the interaction and communication in the social media can reflect on the events of the real world. This causes the value of the information increasing significantly. However, the huge amount of the information requires a method of automatically detecting topics, one of which is the K-means Clustering. Moreover, the large dimensions of data become obstacles. So, we used singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimension of the data prior to the learning process using the K-means Clustering. The accuracy of the combination of SVD and K-means Clustering methods showed comparative results, while the computation time required is likely to be faster than the method of K-means Clustering without any reduction in advance. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>3D scene understanding is important for many applications in the computer vision field. However, the majority of existing solutions commonly assume the images to be captured in clear media. In real world situations, we may encounter less than ideal conditions, for example haze or fog. In these cases, the captured images will contain scattering and veiling effects that obscure the features of the scene. Many studies approach these images by first removing the scattering effects to obtain an approximate clear image. However, by studying the physical model of light propagation in scattering media, we have observed a relation between the captured image intensity and the distance from the camera. Therefore, as a contrast, we attempt to exploit these scattering effects to obtain 3D depth cues. In order to learn the relation between the scattering effects and the depth, we utilize deep networks to help extract and build high-level features. In this paper, we propose a novel classification approach for depth map estimation of hazy images using deep learning. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we propose a method for estimating timeto-contact in scattering media. Images taken in scattering media are often unclear and blurry, making it difficult to detect appropriate geometric information from these images for computing the 3 dimensional properties of the scene. Therefore, instead of searching for geometric information, we attempt to use photometric information instead. In our approach, we use the observed image intensity. The method proposed in this paper is able to utilize the effect of scattering media on the resultant image and estimate the time-to-contact toward objects without any prior knowledge of the scene, cameras, and the scattering media. This method is then evaluated using simulated and real images. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating time-To-contact (TTC) in scattering media environments, such as fog and water. For an object moving towards another object, time-To-contact measures the time remaining until collision. Therefore, it is especially useful for safe automated vehicle navigation in the 3D space. Time-To-contact estimation is advantageous because it does not require camera calibration, freeing it from calibration errors. Earlier studies commonly used geometric features of objects such as edges and points to estimate time-To-contact. In scattering media environments, the degradation of image intensity caused by light scattering makes it difficult to obtain clear geometric features. Thus, in this paper we propose a method for estimating time-To-contact in scattering media by using the photometric features in the image instead. We use statistical priors to obtain depth information from the captured image intensity and compute the time-To-contact from estimated transmission of the media.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents an objective keyword selection method called visualness with Lesk disambiguation (VLD) for describing educational videos with semantic tags. It extends the work on automatically extracting and associating meaningful keywords carried out in 'semantic tags for lecture videos' for efficient indexing and retrieval. VLD uses lecture videos and surrogates documents such as lecture transcripts to extract potential candidate keywords. The candidate keywords undergo a series of selection process extracting fewer but more meaningful keywords based on word sense disambiguation (WSD) and visual similarity. The objective metric then selects top ranking keywords by employing a rank cut-off method. The proposed metric is validated by comparing the automatically selected keywords to those obtained manually, suggesting that the words selected by the proposed objective metric correlate highly with those selected by viewers. The results are further compared to traditional term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and state-of-the-art latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method, with an improved accuracy of 68.18% on 30 lecture videos. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Choosing descriptive keywords to best describe digital media content is crucial for many applications, especially those involving content-based indexing or retrieval. Traditionally such keywords are selected manually, which is labor intensive, restrictive to a limited set of words and inherently subjective to the annotator. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an automatic and objective keyword selection method for annotating video. We specifically used lecture videos and surrogate documents, e.g. transcripts, to extract potential candidate keywords. These potential keywords are then filtered based on a set of seed words to select fewer but more descriptive keywords. The seed words are extracted from the title of the video and subject category. We propose a new objective method to select top ranking keywords based on visual similarity and word sense disambiguation. To validate this approach, the selected keywords are compared to subjectively selected keywords obtained experimentally. Furthermore, the proposed ranking method is also compared to traditional term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and state of the art latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) method. The obtained results show that the words selected by the proposed objective method correlate highly with those selected by viewers. In general, the proposed method performs better than TF-IDF and LDA. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Shape representations using polynomials in computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) and computer graphics are ubiquitous. This paper shows that any bivariate polynomial p(t,u) of total degree d ≤ n can be represented in the form of a blossom of another bivariate polynomial b(t,u) of total degree d evaluated off the diagonal at the linear function pairs (Xj(t),Yj(u)), j = 1, . . ., n, chosen under some conditions expressed in terms of symmetric functions. The bivariate polynomial b(t,u) is called a bud of the bivariate polynomial p(t,u). An algorithm for finding a bud b(t,u) of a given bivariate polynomial p(t,u) is presented. Successively, a bud of b(t,u) can be computed and so on, to form a sequence of representations. The information represented by the original bivariate polynomial is preserved in its buds. This scheme can be used for encoding/ decoding geometric design information. The objects in the encoding/decoding sequence can be rendered graphically and manipulated geometrically like the usual parametric representations. Examples concerning triangular Bézier patches are provided as illustrations. ©2008 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Polynomials, either on their own or as components of splines, play a fundamental role for shape representations in computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) and computer graphics.

The polynomial b(t) is called a bud of the polynomial p(f). An algorithm for finding a bud b(t) of a given polynomial p(t) is presented.

	<dc:abstract>Unlike the Recursive Risch Algorithm for the integration of transcendental elementary functions, the Risch-Norman Method processes the tower of field extensions directly in one step. In addition to logarithmic and exponential field extensions, this method can handle extensions in terms of tangents. Consequently, it allows trigonometric functions to be treated without converting them to complex exponential form. We review this method and describe its implementation in MAPLE. A heuristic enhancement to this method is also presented. © 1989 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The prevalence of autism children has increased rapidly in the last few periods. There is no cure for autism. But the management and treatment of accompanying medical conditions can be done. One of the effects of his medical condition is a sleep disorder. But children with autism have difficulty communicating the disorders they experience. In medicine, the detection of sleep disorders can be done through a test called polysomnography. One of the purposes of this test is to find the patient's sleep patterns through the sleep stage classification. But the doctors need several days to analyze each test. This study proposes an application that can classify it automatically. The method used was based on machine learning. The two classifiers were classification via regression and random committee. The both performances were compared in sleep stages classification for the autism patients. The result showed that random committees had a higher performance than classification via regression. Its performance got more than 85% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. This study also implemented resampling to overcome imbalance class problems. It can be seen that this process was useful in improving the performance of both classifiers. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>It is widely known that visual cues play an important role in speech, especially in disambiguating confusable phonemes or as a means for 'hearing' visually. Interpreting speech only through visual signal is called lip reading. Lip reading has several potential application as a complementary modality to speech recognition or as purely visual speech recognition, which gives rises to silent speech interface, which by itself has numerous practical application. Although the overwhelming potential of such system, research on lip reading for the Indonesian language was extremely limited, with settings still very distant from the real world. This research is an attempt to make a lip reading model that has the potential to be applicable in the real world, specifically by building a lip reading model that supports a variable-length sentence as its input We build the model using deep learning, specifically spatiotemporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) that both respectively form spatiotemporal feature extractor and character-level sentence decoder. During the process, we also investigate whether knowledge on lip reading on other language affects the acquisition of a different language. To the best of our knowledge, our model was the first sentence level Indonesian language lip reading that supports variable-length input. Our model achieved superhuman performance on all metrics, with almost 20× better word accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research proposes a method to detect diabetic retinopathy automatically based on fundus photography evaluation. This automatic method will speed up diabetic retinopathy detection process especially in Indonesia which lack of ophthalmologist. Besides, the difference of doctor ability and experience may produce an inconsistent result. Thus, with this method, we hope automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy will speed up with a consistent result so blindness effect from diabetic retinopathy can be prevented as early as possible. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of neural network variant which can detect the pattern on an image very well. Residual CNN is one of CNN variant which can prevent accuracy degradation for a deep neural network. Therefore this inspire us to apply Residual CNN on diabetic retinopathy. This Residual Network can detect diabetic retinopathy with kappa score 0.51049. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Neural Network can perform various of tasks well after learning process, but still have limitations in remembering. This is due to very limited memory. Differentiable Neural Computer or DNC is proven to address the problem. DNC consist of Neural Network which associated with an external memory module that works like a tape on an accessible Turing Machine. DNC can solve simple problems that require memory, such as copy, graph, and Question Answering. DNC learns the algorithm to accomplish the task based on input and output. In this research, DNC with MLP or Multi-Layer Perceptron as the controller is compared with MLP only. The aim of this investigation is to test the ability of the neural network to learn explicit and implicit knowledge at once. The tasks are sequence classification and sequence addition of MNIST handwritten digits. The results show that MLP which has an external memory is much better than without external memory to process sequence data. The results also show that DNC as a fully differentiable system can solve the problem that requires explicit and implicit knowledge learning at once. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Indonesian audio-visual speech corpus for multimodal automatic speech recognition</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Advancement of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) relies heavily on the availability of the data, even more so for deep learning ASR system which is at the forefront of ASR research. A multitude of such corpus has been built to accommodate such need, ranging from single modal corpus which caters the need for mostly acoustic speech recognition, with several exceptions on visual speech decoding, to multimodal corpus which provides the need for both modalities. Multimodal corpus was significant in the development of ASR as speech is inherently multimodal in the very first place. Despite the importance, none of this corpus was built for Indonesian language, resulting in little to no development of visual-only or multimodal ASR systems. This research is an attempt to solve that problem by constructing AVID, an Indonesian audio-visual speech corpus for multimodal ASR. The corpus consists of 10 speakers speaking 1,040 sentences with a simple structure, resulting in 10,400 videos of spoken sentences. To the best of our knowledge, AVID is the first audio-visual speech corpus for the Indonesian language which is designed for multimodal ASR. AVID was heavily tested and contains overall low errors in both modality tests, which indicates the high quality and suitability of the corpus for building multimodal ASR systems. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the biggest problems facing operators of aging aircraft is making sure that their aircraft is structurally safe. Multiple site fatigue damage (MSD) refers to the presence of multiple fatigue cracks in the same structural element. These cracks interact with each other, rapidly increasing the crack growth rate, and this can result in a more sudden loss of structural integrity. This research is intended to explore the suitability of LSTM (Long and Short Term Memory recurrent neural network) to augment current fracture mechanics-derived analytical methods in the task of accurately predicting the cycle number at which a structural element's residual strength levels have been lowered enough that it cannot sustain the loads it is required to sustain any more. Current methods still require empirically determined correction factors to account for material variability and assembly tolerance-induced scatter. The LSTM tested in this paper is intended to be a part of a larger predictive system that can predict the life of a part, with manufacturing and in-service inspection and load monitoring results as its inputs. The LSTM is trained on a combined dataset, which consists of the fatigue test data from the Federal Aviation Administration's AR-07/22 report, combined with data generated by a crack growth simulator program, with initial conditions and loading similar to that encountered in the FAA's fatigue test. This original version of the model obtained an average MSE of 0.18 and an average MAE of 0.248 on the combined dataset, with the input and the output both normalized and centered. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Multiple site fatigue damage is a problem that affects many operators of aging aircraft. The methods currently in place for prediction of such damage are conservative, sensitive to noise and cannot fully account for grain-level material variations, which results in aircrafts being more conservatively designed than they need to be. The authors augmented the dataset of the FAA AR-07/22 report into a sizable body of variable- and constant-amplitude multiple-site fatigue damage sequences. This was done implementing and tuning the algorithm from AFGROW, implementing the plastic zone linkup criteria for crack interaction, as well as adding Gaussian noise at different stages of the computation. The interim model used for predicting the damage is a hybrid 1-D convolution and bidirectional LSTM model, which achieved an average of 171.26% MAPE, and 4.028 MSLE on the interim version of the dataset. A detailed breakdown of the error characteristics and the hyperparameters that have salient effects on the performance of the model are also examined. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A difficult issue that faces the operators of aging aircraft is to assure the regulators that their aircraft is structurally sound. From a structural perspective, aircrafts are complex and susceptible to fatigue damage due to the usage of aluminium and the proliferation of rivets. Multiple site fatigue damage (MSD) refers to the presence of multiple fatigue cracks in the same structural element. These cracks may interact with each other, increasing their collective growth rates, which may result in a rapid degradation of the structural integrity of the structure. This paper describes this group's experiences related to the usage of 1-D convolutional neural networks (1D ConvNets), in conjunction to fracture mechanics-borne material fatigue damage models in the task of modeling the damage progression of an aircraft lap joint with multiple cracks, subjected to a specific range of possible load sequences. This multivariate regression task is a proxy to the crucial task of estimating the point at which a structural element's residual strength levels have been lowered enough that it cannot sustain the loads it is required to sustain anymore. Current methods of doing the above still require empirically determined correction factors to account for material-related scatter, which require expensive physical tests to determine. The 1D convolutional network is trained on a combined dataset, which consists of the fatigue test data from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) AR-07/22 report, augmented by data generated by a crack growth analysis program, with initial conditions and load sequences akin to those in the FAA's fatigue test. This initial version of the model obtained an average MSE of 1.05, MAE of 0.85 and an average MAPE of 125.26 over the 110-sequence testing set. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we introduce a method to generate photos from sketches using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). This research proposes a method by combining a network to invert sketches into photos (sketch inversion net) with a network to predict color given grayscale images (colorization net). By using this method, the quality of generated photos is expected to be more similar to the actual photos. We first artificially constructed uncontrolled conditions for the dataset. The dataset, which consists of hand-drawn sketches and their corresponding photos, were pre-processed using several data augmentation techniques to train the models in addressing the issues of rotation, scaling, shape, noise, and positioning. Validation was measured using two types of similarity measurements: pixel-difference based and human visual system (HVS) which mimics human perception in evaluating the quality of an image. The pixel-difference based metric consists of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) while the HVS consists of Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). Our method gives the best quality of generated photos for all measures (844.04 for MSE, 19.06 for PSNR, 0.47 for UIQI, and 0.66 for SSIM). © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recommender systems (RS) performance largely depends on diverse types of input that characterize users' preference in the form of both explicit and implicit feedbacks. An explicit feedback is stated directly by an explicit input from users regarding their interest in some options of services or products. Such feedback, however, is not always available. On the other hand, an implicit feedback, which reflects users' opinion indirectly through user behavior is far more abundant. In this paper, we elaborate several ways to improve the RS of three real cases dataset (online travel service, online transportation, and telecommunication service provider) through implicit feedbacks. In the first case, we analyze the effect of a simple feedback from users' input during registration without using any social network analysis (SNA). In the second case, we analyze the effect of community structure extracted from its SNA as its additional attributes. In the third case, we analyze the effect of more additional feedback attributes (modularity, PageRank, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient, weighted in degree, weighted outdegree, weighted degree) which also obtained from the SNA of the corresponding dataset. Given the right hyperparameter settings, we observed RS improvement in term of RMSE (root mean square error) in the three cases. In this paper, three RS models: SVD, SVD++, and difference SVD are used. Besides discussing the RS performance, we also discuss the computational cost incurred from incorporating those implicit feedbacks. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Handwriting recognition on form document using convolutional neural network and support vector machines (CNN-SVM)</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we propose a workflow and a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten characters on form document. The learning model is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a powerful feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a high-end classifier. The proposed method is more efficient than modifying the CNN with complex architecture. We evaluated some SVM and found that the linear SVM using L1 loss function and L2 regularization giving the best performance both of the accuracy rate and the computation time. Based on the experiment results using data from NIST SD 192nd edition both for training and testing, the proposed method which combines CNN and linear SVM using L1 loss function and L2 regularization achieved a recognition rate better than only CNN. The recognition rate achieved by the proposed method are 98.85% on numeral characters, 93.05% on uppercase characters, 86.21% on lowercase characters, and 91.37% on the merger of numeral and uppercase characters. While the original CNN achieves an accuracy rate of 98.30% on numeral characters, 92.33% on uppercase characters, 83.54% on lowercase characters, and 88.32% on the merger of numeral and uppercase characters. The proposed method was also validated by using ten folds cross-validation, and it shows that the proposed method still can improve the accuracy rate. The learning model was used to construct a handwriting recognition system to recognize a more challenging data on form document automatically. The pre-processing, segmentation and character recognition are integrated into one system. The output of the system is converted into an editable text. The system gives an accuracy rate of 83.37% on ten different test form document. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cheating during exams is a problem in the field of education. Cheating during exams undermine the efforts to evaluate the student's proficiency and growth. We propose a real-timecheating detection system using video feed that allows the ability to monitor students during written exams for any illegal behaviors and gestures, such as giving codes, looking at friends, using a cheatsheet, talking and exchanging papers between students. The gestures recognized during the runtime of the video from sequences of actions performed by the subjects which are then used to generate textual descriptions based on the detected cheating gestures. These textual descriptions help the process of documenting activities that transpired during the exams for later use. Our proposed system comprises two primary subsystems, a gesture recognition model based on 3DCNN and XGBoost and a language generation model based on an LSTM network. The gesture recognition model achieves recognition of the cheating gestures with 81.11% accuracy and Kappa statistic 0.760. The language generation model achieves 95.3 % word accuracy and average edit distance 1.076 on single subject description sentences, and 96.6% word accuracy and average edit distance 3.305 on interaction description sentences. The system runs at 32.54 fps on a mid-range laptop. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>EEG channels reduction using PCA to increase XGBoost's accuracy for stroke detection</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>In Indonesia, based on the result of Basic Health Research 2013, the number of stroke patients had increased from 8.3 ‰ (2007) to 12.1 ‰ (2013). These days, some researchers are using electroencephalography (EEG) result as another option to detect the stroke disease besides CT Scan image as the gold standard. A previous study on the data of stroke and healthy patients in National Brain Center Hospital (RS PON) used Brain Symmetry Index (BSI), Delta-Alpha Ratio (DAR), and Delta-Theta-Alpha-Beta Ratio (DTABR) as the features for classification by an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The study got 85% accuracy with sensitivity above 86 % for acute ischemic stroke detection. Using EEG data means dealing with many data dimensions, and it can reduce the accuracy of classifier (the curse of dimensionality). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) could reduce dimensionality and computation cost without decreasing classification accuracy. XGBoost, as the scalable tree boosting classifier, can solve real-world scale problems (Higgs Boson and Allstate dataset) with using a minimal amount of resources. This paper reuses the same data from RS PON and features from previous research, preprocessed with PCA and classified with XGBoost, to increase the accuracy with fewer electrodes. The specific fewer electrodes improved the accuracy of stroke detection. Our future work will examine the other algorithm besides PCA to get higher accuracy with less number of channels. © 2017 Author(s).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Training deep models are time consuming and face many local minima. For dealing with this problem, we can use DBN (Deep Belief Network) with Contrastive Divergence (CD). Sparse representations are more efficient. This paper aims to find the best structure of incorporating sparsity into discriminative DBN. We use a DBN architecture with 784 units as input, two layers each with 500 hidden units, one layer with 2000 hidden units, and 10 units as the final output. We argue that combining sparsity and discriminative DBN may increase the accuracy, but no previous studies suggest the best structure or configuration of that combination that can give the best accuracy. We took three stages of experiments to find the best configuration, namely preliminary, intermediate, and final stages. Each analysis of each stage serves as a background for consideration of the next experiment We use normal sparse for generative DBN and discriminative DBN. Experimental studies on MNIST dataset show that the best structure or scenario to combine normal sparse into deep belief networks is as follows: input - generative (CD) - generative (CD) - normal sparse discriminative (CD). © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research aims to classify cheating activity during exam from video observation. The method uses Conditional Random Field (CRF) for classifying and detecting some classes of cheating activities. The method used to detect the location of the joints of the body is a Multimodal Decomposable Model (MODEC) with superpixel segmentation. The used joints are head, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. The superpixel method is Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). Comparison between MODEC and MODEC + SLIC as feature detector for CRF showed that MODEC + SLIC capable of providing a better activity classification. From our experiments, the cheating activities in average can be detected up to 83.9%. Moving beyond only detecting the class of motion segments, we also devised point-in-time event detection system also using CRF. The time of occurrences of three consecutive cheating activities are determined from a sequence of video frames. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study uses remote sensing technology that can provide information about the condition of the earth's surface area, fast, and spatially. The study area was in Karawang District, lying in the Northern part of West Java-Indonesia. We address a paddy growth stages classification using LANDSAT 8 image data obtained from multi-sensor remote sensing image taken in October 2015 to August 2016. This study pursues a fast and accurate classification of paddy growth stages by employing multiple regularizations learning on some deep learning methods such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks) and 1-D CNN (1-D Convolutional Neural Networks). The used regularizations are Fast Dropout, Dropout, and Batch Normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness, we also compared our method with other machine learning methods such as (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost). The data used are seven bands of LANDSAT-8 spectral data samples that correspond to paddy growth stages data obtained from i-Sky (eye in the sky) Innovation system. The growth stages are determined based on paddy crop phenology profile from time series of LANDSAT-8 images. The classification results show that MLP using multiple regularization Dropout and Batch Normalization achieves the highest accuracy for this dataset. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Humans have the remarkable ability of imagination, where within the human mind virtual simulations are done of scenarios whether visual, auditory or any other senses. These imaginations are based on the experiences during interaction with the real world, where human senses help the mind understand their surroundings. Such level of imagination has not yet been achieved using current algorithms, but a current trend in deep learning architectures known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven capable of generating new and interesting images or videos based on the training data. In that way, GANs can be used to mimic human imagination, where the resulting generated visuals of GANs are based on the data used during training. In this paper, we use a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and 3D GANs to generate videos. We use a 3D Convolutional GAN to generate new human action videos based on trained data. The generated human action videos are used to generate longer videos consisting of a sequence of short actions combined creating longer and more complex activities. To generate the sequence of actions needed we use an LSTM network to translate a simple input description text into the required sequence of actions. The generated chunks are then concatenated using a motion interpolation scheme to form a single video consisting of many generated actions. Hence a visualization of the input text description is generated as a video of a subject performing the activity described. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The study examines the use of quantization to be applied to Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), a combination of the two called qBi-LSTM. Quantization used comes from Deep Belief Networks (DBN). It selected DBN for its superiority as a generative model of Deep Learning in producing an optimal artificial feature. Development of qBi-LSTM is expected to improve the performance of Bi-LSTM and also provide efficient time. The qBi-LSTM test is applied for sleep stage classification on St. Vincent's University Hospital / University College Dublin's Sleep Apnea Database. The result shows that qBi-LSTM has the highest performance compared to Bi-LSTM and DBN with precision, recall and F-measure values of 86.00%, 72.10%, and 75.27%. The best qBi-LSTM performance is to classify Stage 2 but still fails to classify the stage of REM (Rapid Eye Movement).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Word boundary detection is one of the primary components in speech recognition system, which can be learned jointly as part of the speech model or independently as an extra step of preprocessing, reducing the problem into a conditionally independent word prediction. It can also be used to separate Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words in the sentence, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. By itself, word boundary detection is essential in multimodal corpus collection, in which it allows automated and detailed labeling towards the dataset, be it on sentence or word level. In this research, we proposed a novel approach in word boundary detection, that is, by utilizing only visual information, using 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). This research is important in paving the way for a better lip reading system, as well as multimodal speech recognition, as it allows easier creation of novel dataset and enables conventional word-level visual or multimodal speech recognition system to work on continuous speech. Training was done on GRID video corpus on 118 epochs. The proposed model performed well compared to the baseline method, with considerably lower error rate. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we apply MCMCLDA (Multi-class Markov Chain Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to classify abnormal activity of students in an examination. Abnormal activity in exams is defined as a cheating activity. We compare the usage of Harris3D interest point detector and a human joints detector, MODEC (Multimodal Decomposable Models), as the feature detector. Experiment results show that using MODEC to detect arm joints and head location as interest point gives better performance in accuracy and computational time than Harris3D when classifying cheating activity. MODEC suffers low accuracy due to its inability to differentiate elbow and wrist when the object wears clothes with indistinguishable colors. Meanwhile, Harris3D detects too many irrelevant interest point to recognize cheating activity reliably. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Human Action recognition research is an interesting and active field of research in the current years. Human Action Recognition (HAR) has many potential and promising applications, in such fields as security, surveillance, professional sports, and human computer interaction. One of the ongoing challenges of HAR is the creation of methods that are subject invariant, that is methods of action recognition that is not influenced by the appearance of the object in question. One the methods that has been quite popular in recent years are methods that are based on the kinematic features of the action to be recognized. Such feature are based on the optical flow of the pixel in time, and include features such as the divergence, curl (vorticity) among others. These features are proven to be subject invariant and can easily be calculated in a frame by frame basis. In this study, we present an analysis of feature classification techniques for action classification based on such kinematic features. In this paper, we build a multilayer neural network model trained using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) that achieves 70% cross validation accuracy on the Weizmann dataset using kinematic features. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Predicting and estimating the character of big data becomes paramount since it is laborious to deal with big data with conventional models and algorithms. Remote sensing big data from various satellites consist of many large-scale images that are exceptionally complex in terms of their structural, spectral, and textual features. Also, most of them are still in annotated form. Therefore, it is a challenge to explore them for detecting objects on the ground that are beneficial to humans using their sophisticated features. In this paper, we proposed a remote sensing big data for paddy growth stages detection, through multi-temporal analysis with a heuristic algorithm. Information derived from growth stages is very useful to know the needs of water, fertilizer, and crop planting calendar to increase productivity. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Big non-stationary data, which comes in gradual fashion or stream, is one important issue in the application of big data to train deep learning machines. In this paper, we focused on a unique variant of traditional autoencoder, which is called Marginalized Linear Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (MLSDA). MLSDA uses a simple linear model. It is faster and uses less number of parameters than the traditional SDA. It also takes advantages of convex optimization. It has better improvement in the bag of words feature representation. However, the traditional SDA with stochastic gradient descent has been more widely accepted in many applications. The stochastic gradient descent is naturally an online learning. It makes the traditional SDA more scalable for streaming big data. This paper proposes a simple modification of MLSDA. Our modification uses matrix multiplication concept for online learning. The experiment result showed the similar accuracy level compared with a batch version of MLSDA and using lower computation resources. The online MLSDA will improve the scalability of MLSDA for handling streaming big data that representing bag of words features for natural language processing, information retrieval, and computer vision. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Human action recognition is a task of analyzing human action that occurs in a video. This paper investigates action recognition by using two classification techniques, namely Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a technique for supervised classification that used in statistics and machine learning. By separating the distinct class with a maximum possible wide gap, SVM tries to predict the respective class given a set of input data. On the other hand, RVM is a Bayesian model of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that has an identical function with SVM. RVM uses significantly fewer basis functions as it uses Bayesian inference with a prior distribution on weight thus makes solution sparse. Experimental studies on a human action dataset show that RVM is better as compared to SVM on action recognition. Although RVM takes more training time, however, it requires fewer testing time than SVM. RVM model is more general because it contains minimum basis function. Therefore, it is more robust compared to SVM. RVM performs good classification on action recognition that contains large dataset. © 2016 IIJ.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text mining poses more challenges, for example, more unstructured text, the fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug, the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, and the multiple token representations for a single drug name. Although many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN model, that is, MLP. The second technique involves two deep network classifiers, that is, DBN and SAE. The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, that is, LSTM. In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average F-score being 0.8645. © 2016 Mujiono Sadikin et al.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A machine learning method needs to adapt to over time changes in the environment. Such changes are known as concept drift. In this paper, we propose concept drift tackling method as an enhancement of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and Constructive Enhancement OS-ELM (CEOS-ELM) by adding adaptive capability for classification and regression problem. The scheme is named as adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM). It is a single classifier scheme that works well to handle real drift, virtual drift, and hybrid drift. The AOS-ELM also works well for sudden drift and recurrent context change type. The scheme is a simple unified method implemented in simple lines of code. We evaluated AOS-ELM on regression and classification problem by using concept drift public data set (SEA and STAGGER) and other public data sets such as MNIST, USPS, and IDS. Experiments show that our method gives higher kappa value compared to the multiclassifier ELM ensemble. Even though AOS-ELM in practice does not need hidden nodes increase, we address some issues related to the increasing of the hidden nodes such as error condition and rank values. We propose taking the rank of the pseudoinverse matrix as an indicator parameter to detect "underfitting" condition. © 2016 Arif Budiman et al.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many real-world gesture datasets are by nature containing unbalanced number of poses across classes. Such imbalance severely reduces bag-of-poses based classification performance. On the other hand, collecting a dataset of human gestures or actions is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. It is often impractical to reacquire the data or to modify the existing dataset using oversampling or undersampling procedures. The best way to handle such imbalance is by making the used classifier be directly aware and adapt to the real condition inside the data. Balancing class distribution, i.e., the number of pose samples per class, is one of difficult tasks in machine learning. Standard statistical learning models (e.g., SVM, HMM, CRF) are insensitive to unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a distribution-sensitive prior on a standard statistical learning, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), to deal with the imbalanced data problem. This prior analyzes the training dataset before learning a model. Thus, the RVM can put more weight on the samples from under-represented classes, while allows overall samples from the dataset to have a balanced impact to the learning process. Our experiment uses a publicly available gesture datasets, the Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Experimental results show the importance of adapting to the unbalanced data and improving the recognition performance through distribution-sensitive prior. © 2015 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a modified Temporal Deep Belief Networks (TDBN) for human motion analysis and synthesis by incorporating Sparse Encoding Symmetric Machines (SESM) improvement on its pre-training. SESM consisted of two important terms: regularization and sparsity. In this paper, we measure the effect of these two terms on the smoothness of synthesized (or generated) motion. The smoothness is measured as the standard deviation of five bones movements with three motion transitions. We also address how these two terms influence the free energy and reconstruction error profiles during pre-training of the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) layers and the Conditional RBM (CRBM) layers. For this purpose, we compare gait transitions by bifurcation experiments using four different TDBN settings: original TDBN; modified-TDBN(R): a TDBN with only regularization constraint; modified-TDBN(S): a TDBN with only sparsity constraint; and modified-TDBN(R+S): a TDBN with regularization plus sparsity constraints. These experiments shows that the modified-TDBN(R+S) reaches lower energy faster in RBM pre-training and reach lower reconstruction error in the CRBM training. Even though the smoothness of the synthesized motion from the modified-TDBN approaches is slightly less smooth than the original TDBN, they are more responsive to the action command to change a motion (from run to walk or vice versa) while preserving the smoothness during motion transitions without incurring much overhead computation time. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT &amp; LLS.

	<dc:abstract>Satellite remote sensing has essentially been applied in agriculture such as monitoring paddy growth stages, cropping schedule, and fertilizer management over vast areas. Many methods have been devoted for detecting paddy growth stages by deriving a certain profiles of vegetation indices from high temporal resolution satellite data. In this paper, we introduce a time-variant method referred to as a heuristic decision tree (HDT) for detecting 3-classes of paddy growth stages from a limited number of MODIS images and generalize the result through machine learning to predict the growth stages in time-invariant manner. We compared our proposed method to two previous studies in [8] and [9]. For the time-variant case, all methods are validated by 124 times of observation data among 50 reference points from field survey. After doing some adjustments for calculating the accuracy, the result shows that the accuracy for [8, 9], and our proposed method are 0.8951, 0.9375, and 0.9435 respectively. For the time-invariant case, we evaluate three Kernel-based Regularized (KR) classification methods, i.e. Principal Component Regression (KRPCR), Extreme Learning Machine (KR-ELM), and Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM). All data samples are divided into training (25%) and testing (75%) sampling, and all models are trained and tested through 10-rounds random bootstrap re-sampling method to obtain more variety on hypothesis models during learning. The best model for each classifier method is defined as the one with the highest kappa coefficient during testing. The experimental results for 3-classes of paddy growth stages prediction show that the classification accuracy in testing for our proposed method of each learner are 0.8485, 0.8874, and 0.8252 respectively, whereas for previous study [8] are 0.6845, 0.7845, and 0.6949 respectively. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT &amp; LLS.

	<dc:abstract>Most current studies have been applying high temporal resolution satellite data for determining paddy crop phenology, that derive into a certain vegetation indices, by using some filtering and smoothing techniques combined with threshold methods. In this paper, we introduce a time invariant detection of paddy growth stages using single temporal resolution satellite data instead of high temporal resolution with complex cropping pattern. Our system is a kernelbased regularized learner that predicts paddy growth stages from six-bands spectral of Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. It evaluates three Kernel-based Regularized (KR) classification methods, i.e. Principal Component Regression (KR-PCR), Extreme Learning Machine (KR-ELM), and Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (RBFSVM). All data samples are divided into training (25%) and testing (75%) sampling, and all models are trained and tested through 10-rounds random bootstrap re-sampling method to obtain more variety on hypothesis models during learning. The best model for each classifier method is defined as the one which has the highest kappa coefficient during testing. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of each classifiers on testing are high competitive, i.e. 84.08%, 84.04%, and 84.95% respectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Visual tracking in mobile robots have to track various target objects in fast processing, but existing state-ofthe- art methods only use specific image feature which only suitable for certain target objects. In this paper, we proposed new approach without depend on specific feature. By using deep learning, we can learn essential features of many of the objects and scenes found in the real world. Furthermore, fast visual tracking can be achieved by using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The developed tracking algorithm is based on bootstrap particle filter. Thus the observation model of particle filter is enhanced into two steps: offline training step and online tracking step. The offline training stage is carried out by training one kind of deep learning techniques: Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) with auxiliary image data. During the online tracking process, an additional classification layer based on ELM is added to the encoder part of the trained. Using experiments, we found (i) the specific feature is only suitable for certain target objects (ii) the running time of the tracking algorithm can be improved by using ELM with regularization and intensity adjustment in online step, (iii) dynamic model is crucial for object tracking, especially when adjusting the diagonal covariance matrix values. Preliminary experimental results are provided. The algorithm is still restricted to track single object and will extend to track multiple object and will enhance by creating the advanced dynamic model. These are remaining for our future works. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT &amp; LLS. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We introduce a constructive, robust, and adaptive OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Machine Learning) that combines learning strategies of Constructive Enhancement OSELM and Robust OS-ELM, and add adaptive capability to receive a new target class requirement during sequential learning and applied in human action recognition. The overall strategy is aimed to deal against parameters tuning and new requirements drift problem in the sequential learning process that commonly happened in human action recognition. Our proposed method has an automatic and systematic approach for determining input weight and bias value when the hidden nodes need to be increased to handle a larger training data size and to adjust the output weight when the new target class label is presented during sequential learning. We demonstrated the capability using 2013 Challenge on Multi modal Gesture Recognition open dataset (Chalearn 2013) with uni modal features (skeleton data) only. Our experiments using skeletons of upper body joints features with normalized euclidean distance and projection angle position coordinates to shoulder center and hip center, clustering analysis with k-means for pose based generation and Bag of Pose (BoP) for temporal sequential information. We developed the training sequence scenario to introduce the partial action classes in the initial training and the rest of training data with all classes in the next sequences to simulate the condition when the OS-ELM received new target class requirement drift. Our proposed method gives better accuracy plus adaptive capability compared with SUMO method which is the best uni modal method for chalearn data and still maintain a reasonably small computation time. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In 3D human motion pose-based analysis, the main problem is how to classify multi-class label activities based on primitive action (pose) inputs efficiently for both accuracy and processing time. Because, pose is not unique and the same pose can be anywhere on different activity classes. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in 3D human motion analysis based on pose cluster. ELM has reputation as eager classifier with fast training and testing time but the classification result originally has still low testing accuracy even by increasing the hidden nodes number and adding more training data. To achieve better accuracy, we pursue a feature selection method to reduce the dimension of pose cluster training data in time sequence. We propose to use frequency of pose occurrence. This method is similar like bag of words which is a sparse vector of occurrence counts of poses in histogram as features for training data (bag of poses). By using bag of poses as the optimum feature selection, the ELM performance can be improved without adding network complexity (Hidden nodes number and training data). © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper pursues the best multiclass classification strategy for pose-based 3D human motion recognition using Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Such classification task is one of the most difficult classification problem because the pose is not unique and the same pose might be randomly distributed inside any unrelated and absolutely different activities. In this study, bag of poses are selected as features and several multiclass classification strategies commonly used in binary classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) are adopted into the ELM implementation and then compared with non-binary classifications of ELM and binary classifications of SVM. A number of multiclass strategies such as One-Against-All (OAA), One-Against-One (OAO), Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), hierarchical binary tree, and OAO-3Tree are evaluated and analysed. We found that the OAO-3Tree strategy using Max-Win vote fusion of labeled output function gives the best result. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a fingertips tracking system based on particle filter using Microsoft Kinect. The tracking is performed in two separate modules: image-based 2D position tracking and calibrated 1D depth tracking. The two modules is then combined to represent full 3D fingertips tracking. The separation is aimed for faster tracking by putting as most processing as possible in 2D while 3D position is obtained by just incorporating available depth information. Moreover, the error in 2D tracking can be corrected using the information from depth tracking and vice-versa. The fingertips are obtained by 2D convex hull algorithm on binary images which is extracted after setting a depth threshold. This assumes that hand and fingers is the foremost part of object nearest to camera during interaction. To deal with partial occlusion, we devised a simple retrace algorithm based on linear time-series analysis of fingertips trajectory. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system we design several scenarios involving contactless user interaction for zooming and motion capture for 3D animation creation. The evaluation is measured in terms of tracking accuracy and overhead computation. The 2D+1D tracking is experimentally shown to be more robust to occlusion with reasonably little overhead computation time. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Remote sensing technology plays an important role in agriculture applications, especially for paddy growth stages classification, which is a critical process in predicting crop production. The analysis of multi bands data covering very large swath areas using iterative methods such as neural network or SVM will certainly cost much computation time. This paper addresses this problem by taking advantage from a non-iterative tuning capability of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for paddy growth stages classification using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing images. The accuracy of classification is measured by Cohen's kappa. Seven classes are used in classification, with consist of six classes for paddy growth stages and one class for dominated cloud. The contribution of this study is a new ensemble incremental approaches based on random bootstrap resampling for basic ELM (B-ELM) and Error Minimized ELM (EM-ELM) are applied to build multi-class classifier using two types of hidden nodes function, i.e. additive and radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes. The classification results were compared each other with these two types of hidden nodes. Our ensemble incremental approach successfully classify seven paddy growth stages and significantly improve the overall kappa coefficient to 10.2% higher with only in average 7 nodes addition overhead. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a paddy growth stages classification using MODIS remote sensing images with support vector machines (SVMs). We collected the paddy growth stages data samples from a series of MODIS mages acquired from March to July 2012 along paddy field area only. The data are collected based on growth stages phenology of paddy using spectral profile which consists of at least 9 classes for growth stages and 2 classes for dominated soil and cloud. We apply SVMs to build a binary classifier for each class with one against all strategy of multiclass approach. One important issue needed to address is unbalanced prior probability that should be solved by each SVM. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of balanced branches strategy that is applied to one against all SVMs learning. Our results shows that the balanced branches strategy does improves in average around 10% classification accuracy during training and validation, and in average around 50% during testing. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recently, hyperspectral images are used to estimate the yield of food crops. The images consist of a large number of bands which requires sophisticated method for its analysis. One approach to reduce computational cost and to accelerate knowledge discovery is by eliminating bands that do not add value to the analysis. In this paper, a genetic algorithm based new sequence of principal component regression (GA-NSPCR) method is proposed and tested using 116 band HyMap airborne hyperspectral data and yield data collected from paddy fields. The proposed method uses GA to select an initial subset of hyperspectral bands, and subsequently generate a more accurate subset by measuring the minimum error of prediction model defined by principal component regression (PCR). Unlike standard PCR methods which order the features based on singular values, in each generation NSPCR orders the features based on squared multiple correlation coefficient R2. Yield data and spectral data are used to generate a separate training and testing dataset using 8 times bootstrap resampling (8-rounds BSR) to deal with limited number of samples in training data. Differed from standard GA impelementation, the fitness function evaluates three Lp-norms to obtain the best prediction model. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in monitoring and preventing heart attacks. In this paper, we propose and compare the use of Daubechies WT (Daubechies Wavelet Transformation), Kernel PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and PCA as feature extraction methods in improving arrhythmia signals classification. The Kernel PCA employs linear, polynomial, and Gaussian kernels. We examine Support Vector Machines (SVM) pattern classifier with various kernels including wavelet, linear, Gaussian and polynomial. The ECG signals are obtained from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The task is to classify or distinguish four different arrhythmias from normal ECG. The overall classification system is comprised of three components including data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. In data preprocessing which depends on how the initial data is prepared, we reduce the baseline noise with cubic spline and cut the signal beat by beat using pivot R peak. Finally, ECG signal is classified by SVM using various kernels, our experimental results show that wavelet gives better results compared to other feature extraction methods. The accuracy of Wavelet Daubechies for feature extraction is 100% and the best kernel function for the SVM classification is Linier kernel and wavelet kernel. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Research topics in robotic application is quite varies but one of the most interesting topic is odor source localization. This research combine the robot ability to recognize odor and track the movement so that robot can find the source. Most of the research are done to improve the algorithm to localize the source by using simulation software. This paper tries to verify the robustness of one of the localization method known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the real-world implementation. This paper will shows robot model that used in the experiment and also discuss the architecture to implement robot behavior. A group of mobile robots equipped with wireless communication device and odor sensors is employed. The experiment is conduct in area of 488cm × 488cm with dynamic odor source in one end. The experiment also used a set of camera to track robots position. The experiement result verifies that PSO is technically sound for real-world odor source localization. In this experiment, PSO can localized the source in 360 seconds or bellow.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing non-overlapping transparent and opaque surfaces from multiple view images. The reconstruction is attained through progressive refinement of an initial 3D shape by minimizing the error between the images of the object and the initial 3D shape. The challenge is to simultaneously reconstruct both the transparent and opaque surfaces given only a limited number of images. Any refinement methods can theoretically be applied if analytic relation between pixel value in the training images and vertices position of the initial 3D shape is known. This paper investigates such analytic relations for reconstructing opaque and transparent surfaces. The analytic relation for opaque surface follows diffuse reflection model, whereas for transparent surface follows ray tracing model. However, both relations can be converged for reconstruction both surfaces into texture mapping model. To improve the reconstruction results several strategies including regularization, hierarchical learning, and simulated annealing are investigated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</dc:abstract>

The object may contain non-overlapping transparent and opaque surfaces. The challenge is to simultaneously reconstruct the transparent and opaque surfaces given only a limited number of views. By minimizing the pixel error between the output images of this NN and teacher images, we want to refine vertices position of an initial 3D polyhedron model to approximate the true shape of the object. For that purpose, we incorporate a ray tracing formulation into our NN's mapping and learning. At the implementation stage, we develop a practical regularization learning method using texture mapping instead of ray tracing. By choosing an appropriate regularization parameter and optimizing using hierarchical learning and annealing strategies, our NN gives more approximate shape. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a new neural network (NN) scheme for recovering three dimensional (3D) transparent surface. We view the transparent surface modeling, not as a separate problem, but as an extension of opaque surface modeling. The main insight of this work is we simulate transparency not only for generating visually realistic images, but for recovering the object shape. We construct a formulation of transparent surface modeling using ray tracing framework into our NN. We compared this ray tracing method, with a texture mapping method that simultaneously map the silhouette images and smooth shaded images (obtained form our NN), and textured images (obtained from the teacher image) to an initial 3D model. By minimizing the images error between the output images of our NN and the teacher images, observed in multiple views, we refine vertices position of the initial 3D model. We show that our NN can refine the initial 3D model obtained by polarization images and converge into more accurate surface.

	<dc:abstract>We introduce a multiple-view 3D-shape-reconstruction system. This system is able to fuse few-view and erroneous depth maps into a more complete and more accurate shape representation using a unique neural network (NN). The NN provides analytic mapping and learning of a polyhedron model to approximate the true shape of an object based on multiple-view depth maps. The depth maps are obtained by a widely used Tsai-Shah shape-from-shading (SFS) algorithm. They are considered as partial 3D shapes of the object to be reconstructed. The main insight of this work is that the NN minimizes the depth map error in one view using depth maps information from other views observed under nonfixed light source positions relative to the object. Theoretically, we formulate our problem as nonparametric (local) regression in depth space formed by multiple view observations. Experimentally, we obtain exact and stable results through hierarchical reconstruction and annealing reinforcement.

	<dc:abstract>The aim of this paper is to attain a fast and realistic 3D face reconstruction, when only a limited set of images taken from multiple views, is available. Instead of relying merely on 2D images as suggested by image-based modeling approaches, we investigate several shape-from-shading (SFS) techniques, which have been studied extensively in computer vision research. This is because we believe that a nearly complete set of images required by image-based modeling techniques is rarely available in real world applications. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of three different SFS algorithms to provide partial 3D shapes of the face to be reconstructed. Each algorithm is selected from three different classes of SFS technique, i.e., linear, propagation, and minimization approaches. The reconstruction process is performed by our novel neural network learning scheme, which is able to successively refine the polygon vertices parameter of an initial 3D shape, based on depth maps of several calibrated images. To evaluate the reconstruction result based on those SFS techniques, we measure average vertex-error and pixel-error compared to actual 3D data obtained by 3D scanner device. We also compared these result with those obtained by using only 2D images. In addition, we also measure total computational time needed in the reconstruction process. © 2002 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we present a neural-network learning scheme for face reconstruction. This scheme, which we called as Smooth Projected Polygon Representation Neural Network (SPPRNN), is able to successively refine the polygon's vertices parameter of an initial 3D shape based on depth-maps of several calibrated images taken from multiple views. The depth-maps, which are obtained by deploying Tsai-Shah shape-from-shading (SFS) algorithm, can be considered as partial 3D shapes of the face to be reconstructed. The reconstruction is finalized by mapping the texture of face images to the initial 3D shape. There are three interesting issues investigated in this paper concerning the effectiveness of this scheme. First, how effective the SFS provides partial 3D shapes compared to if we simply used 2D images. Secondly, how essential a smooth projected polygonal model is needed in order to approximate the face structure and enhance the convergence rate of this scheme. Thirdly, how an appropriate initial 3D shape should be selected and used in order to improve model resolution and learning stability. By carefully addressing those three issues, it was shown from our experiment that a compact and realistic 3D model of human (mannequin) face could be obtained.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The paper describes the application of a neural processing for extracting bispectrum feature of speech data, and the use of probabilistic neural network as a classifier in an automatic speech recognition system. The usually used feature extraction paradigm in the early development of the speech recognition system is power spectrum analysis, however, the recognition rate of this system is not high enough, especially when a Gaussian noise is added to the utterance speech data. In this paper, we developed a speaker identification system using bispectrum feature analysis. To analyse the distribution of the bispectrum data along its two dimensional representation, we developed an adaptive feature extraction mechanism of the bispectrum speech data based on cascade neural network. A cascade configuration of SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Map) and LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) is used as an adaptive codebook generation algorithm for determining the feature distribution of the bispectrum speech data. The K-L transformation (K-LT) technique is then used as a preprocessing element before the neural classifier is utilized. This K-LT has shown as an effective procedure for orthogonalization and dimensionality reduction of the codebook vectors generated from bispectrum data. Experimental results show that our system could perform with high recognition rate on the undirected utterance speech, especially when a higher number of codebook vectors are utilized. It is also shown that the use of PNN could increase the recognition rate significantly, even using speech data with additional Gaussian noise. © 2001 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The work described in this paper addresses the problem for extracting bispectrum feature of speech data. Very often the bispectrum feature extraction and data reduction are complicated due to some limiting constraints, i.e., no prior knowledge of feature's distribution and higher dimensionality of bispectrum data. In this article we developed an adaptive feature extraction mechanism based on cascade neural network in conjunction with feature's dimensionality reduction based on Karhunen-Loeve transformation technique. An adaptive codebook generation algorithm which is a cascade configuration of SOFM (Self Organizing Feature Map) and LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) was used before the K-L transformation. The transformation was experimentally shown as an effective procedure for orthogonalization and dimensionality reduction of bispectrum feature. Performance of our speaker identification system was perceived to be significantly increased eventhough using limited number of channels in noisy environment. We also tried to improve the capability of adaptive codebook generation algorithm by applying simplified differential competitive learning (SDCL) network.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An artificial odor recognition system is developed in order to mimic the human sensory test in cosmetics, perfume and beverage industries. A backpropagation neural network is used as the pattern recognition system and shows high recognition capability. However, the system only works efficiently when it is used to discriminate a limited number of odors. The unlearned odor will be classified as one of the already learned category. To improve the system's capability, a fuzzy learning vector quantization neural network is developed and utilized in experiments on four different ethanol concentrations, and three different kinds of fragrance odor from Martha Tilaar Cosmetics. The results shows that the FLVQ has a comparable ability for recognizing the already known category of odors. However, the FLVQ algorithm can cluster the unknown odor in a different new class of odor. © 1999 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Product Lines (SPL) enable a software to have various products in single development. The products possess commonality and variability that should be defined in the problem domain. Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is one of executable modeling language that supports SPL by implementing Delta Oriented Programming (DOP). In DOP, features that is related with the variability will be implemented in the delta modules (deltas). Deltas will modify a basic product to create (new) various products. Thus the various features and products will be managed well in delta modeling. On the other hand, there is Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standard and popular modeling language. UML is not designed to model SPL, but UML has a mechanism to extend their syntax and semantics by defining UML Profile. In this paper, we aim to bridge UML and SPL automatically by having an automatic traslation program. The program will produce UML model based on ABS model, that supports SPL, by using UML-DOP Profile. Besides connecting UML and SPL, the program can also help the developer to achieve coherency between design and implementation. As the results, the UML models produced by automatic translator are represented by XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) documents. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The rapid growth of Twitter usage attracts many researchers to utilize Twitter data for several purposes, including emotion analysis. However, there is a resource limitation in standard dataset for emotion analysis task for under-resourced language, especially Indonesian. In this study, we build an Indonesian twitter dataset for emotion classification task which is publicly available. In addition, we conduct feature engineering to decide the best feature in emotion classification. The features used in this research are lexicon-based, Bag-of-Words, word embeddings, orthography and Part-Of-Speech (POS)tag features. We test those features in two datasets with different characteristics. F1-score is employed as an evaluation metric. The results of our experiments show that implementing the combination of all proposed features in our built dataset can achieve 69.73% of F1-Score, which outperforms the baseline model by 26.64%. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Music era is one of Music Information Retrieval research that connecting several songs with similar characteristics from similar year or decade but not limited to particular genre and mood. Previous researcher tried to recognize musical era with classification model using single audio feature like spectrogram and chromagram, but the performance was poor. Feature and model selection affect classification era performance. One of the challenge in selecting feature is whether the using of multimodal or combination of audio features can improve music era classification performance. In this research, Hierarchical-level fusion model is used to combine several audio features like spectrogram and chromagram to determine music era. We obtained both 83% and 73% overall accuracy for Indonesian Music Dataset (IMD) and Million Song Dataset (MSD) of era classification tasks using Hierarchical-level fusion model. This research result also strengthened with overall precision, recall, and F-score result 0.83,0.82, 0.82 for IMD dataset and 0.73, 0.72, 0.72 for MSD dataset experiment. © 2019 IEEE.

	<dc:abstract>Web-based question answering services facilitate users to seek more personalized health-related information. However, the users sometimes have to wait for a while until their questions to be answered. Automatic question answering research can assist the system to generate or retrieve the answer to users. Our work was a pioneering study on consumer-health question answering for Bahasa Indonesia. We built a corpus of 86,731 consumer-health questions, collected from 5 different websites. As part of annotation, we classify the sub-topics for each question, which corresponds to medical specialization. Question sub-topic classification is completed by two complementary approaches: dictionary-based and machine learning-based. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Question proccessing is an important step in automatic question answering system. Texts from online healthcare consultation forum posts contain question. However, the narrative text of forum post needs to be decomposed to identify the question. We propose a question decomposition module for healthcare forum post in Bahasa Indonesia. The module consists of three main components, namely sentence splitter, sentence classifier, and multi-questions splitter. We apply machine learning approach for sentence classification and rule-based chunking approach for multi-questions splitting. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Ambiguity is a problem we frequently face in Natural Language Processing. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a task to determine the correct sense of an ambiguous word. However, research in WSD for Indonesian is still rare to find. The availability of English-Indonesian parallel corpora and WordNet for both languages can be used as training data for WSD by applying Cross-Lingual WSD method. This training data is used as an input to build a model using supervised machine learning algorithms. Our research also examines the use of Word Embedding features to build the WSD model. © 2018 Global WordNet Association. All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Combining topological and topical features for community detection</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Community detection is an important approach to identify community's structure in a network and can also be considered as graph clustering. This paper conducted a research about community detection using combined topological and topical features in Twitter. The combined features were compared to topological only and topical only. The topological features that were used are following-follower relationship and retweet-favorite ratio while topical features are hashtags, mentions, links and tweets. This research proposed a new node weight using retweet-favorite ratio to build topological matrix and it has been proved to have higher purity value by 30-40% and higher rand index value by 10-20%. The purity value of combining topological and topical features is also improved by 30% compared to using following-follower relationship as topological features. The highest rand index and purity values are achieved by matrix of combinied topological and topical features with multilevel community detection as clustering algorithm with 0.89 and 0.77. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:title>Gated Recurrent Neural Tensor Network</dc:title>
	<dc:abstract>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are a powerful scheme for modeling temporal and sequential data need to capture long-term dependencies on datasets and represent them in hidden layers with a powerful model to capture more information from inputs. For modeling long-term dependencies in a dataset, the gating mechanism concept can help RNNs remember and forget previous information. Representing the hidden layers of an RNN with more expressive operations (i.e., tensor products) helps it learn a more complex relationship between the current input and the previous hidden layer information. These ideas can generally improve RNN performances. In this paper, we proposed a novel RNN architecture that combine the concepts of gating mechanism and the tensor product into a single model. By combining these two concepts into a single RNN, our proposed models learn long-term dependencies by modeling with gating units and obtain more expressive and direct interaction between input and hidden layers using a tensor product on 3-dimensional array (tensor) weight parameters. We use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) RNN and combine them with a tensor product inside their formulations. Our proposed RNNs, which are called a Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Tensor Network (LSTMRNTN) and Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Tensor Network (GRURNTN), are made by combining the LSTM and GRU RNN models with the tensor product. We conducted experiments with our proposed models on word-level and character-level language modeling tasks and revealed that our proposed models significantly improved their performance compared to our baseline models. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many successful methods for training deep neural networks (DNN) rely on an unsupervised pretraining algorithm. It is particularly effective when the number of labeled training samples is not large enough, because pretraining method helps to initialize the parameter values in the appropriate range near a local good minimum, for further discriminative finetuning. However, while the improvement is impressive, training DNN is difficult because the objective function of DNN is highly non-convex function of the parameters. To avoid placing the parameter that generalizes poorly, a robust generative modelling is necessary. This paper explore an alternative of generative modelling for pretraining DNN-based acoustic modelling using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) within autoencoder framework called Variational Bayes Autoencoder (VBAE). It performs an efficient approximate inference and learning with directed probabilistic graphical models. During fine-tuning, probabilistic encoder parameters with latent variable components are then used in discriminative training for acoustic model. Here, we investigate the performances of DNN-based acoustic model using the proposed pretrained VBAE in comparison with widely used pretraining algorithms like Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE). The results reveal that VBAE pretraining with Gaussian latent variables gave the best performance. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Research in the field of spoken language identification (spoken LID) on local languages helps to extend the outreach of technology to local language speakers. This research also contributes to the preservation of local languages. In this paper, we report our work on identifying spoken data in three local Indonesian languages: Minangkabau, Sundanese and Javanese. Statistical phonotactics models are created to map the speech signals into the language used by the speaker. We use two phonotactics methods, namely Phone Recognition followed by Language Modelling (PRLM) and Parallel Phone Recognition followed by Language Modelling (PPRLM). PRLM method shows the highest accuracy using the phone recognizer trained for English and Russian with the average of 77.42% and 75.94% respectively. © 2016 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The widespread use of social media today has generated lots of research interest towards information retrieval, natural language processing, and also machine learning. The vast diversity of languages used on social media creates the need for accurate automated language identification tools. In this research, we develop a language identification tool that can help automatically identify social media posts in Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, and Minangkabau. The latter three are some of the most widely spoken regional languages in Indonesia. We conducted experiments to compare three popular methods used to develop language identification tools, namely N-grams, statistical models, and the Small Words technique. Our experiments conducted using articles on internet for training and tested using social media data that we constructed, show that the statistical method obtains the best result among all the methods used. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cultural diversity helps to make our world rich and vital. The world's population of indigenous people now numbers some 350 million individuals representing nearly 6000 languages and cultures. However, if nothing is done, half of those languages spoken today will disappear by the end of this century. The Fifth International Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages (SLTU 2016) was organized to provide a forum for researchers and industrial counterparts to share achievements and challenges in all areas related to natural language processing and spoken language processing of under-resourced languages, including: linguistic studies of under-resourced languages, resources acquisition of text and speech corpora, zero resource speech technologies, cross-lingual/multi-lingual acoustic and lexical modeling, speech recognition and synthesis for under-resourced languages, machine translation and natural language processing for under-resourced languages, and applications of spoken language technologies for under-resourced languages. SLTU 2016 is the fifth in a series of even-year SLTU Workshops. Four previous Workshops were organized: SLTU'14 in St. Petersburg (Russia), SLTU'12 in Cape Town (South Africa), SLTU'10 in Penang (Malaysia), and SLTU'08 in Hanoi (Vietnam). SLTU 2016, which is adopted as ISCA ITRW, will be held on May 9-12, 2016, in Yogyakarta (Indonesia), a centre of classical Javanese culture. There are more than 700 ethnic languages spoken in Indonesian archipelago, but 146 are endangered. Therefore, SLTU 2016 has special focus on under-resourced languages and endangered languages. SLTU 2016 continues the tradition of previous SLTUs that feature a number of distinguished keynote speaker, and this year, for the first time, SLTU will also offer Interactive Tutorial on ASR-Kaldi and TTS-Festival on Under-Resourced Language. Independently of the scientific actions we will provide excellent possibilities for acquaintance with cultural and historical valuables of Yogyakarta city and its beautiful surroundings. © 2016 The Authors.

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we report the first effort of constructing emo- tion lexicon by utilizing Twitter as source of data. Specifically we used hashtag feature to obtain tweets with certain emotion label in English. There are eight emotion classes used in our work, comprising of angry, disgust, fear, joy, sad, surprise, trust and anticipation that refer to the Plutchik's wheel. To obtain the lexicon, we first ranked the words ac- cording to its term frequency. After that, we reduced some irrelevant words by removing words with low frequency. We also enriched the lexicon with the synonym and conducted filtering by utilizing sentiment lexicon (40,288 words). As result, we successfully constructed 4 Hashtag-Based Emo- tion (HBE) Lexicons through different procedures and called them as HBE-A1 (50,613 words), HBE-B1 (23,400 words), HBE-A2 (26,909 words) and HBE-B2 (14,905 words). In our experiment, we used the lexicons in investigating Twitter Sentiment Analysis and the result reveals that our proposed emotion lexicons can boost the accuracy and even improve over than NRC-Emotion lexicon. It is also worth noting that our construction idea is simple, automatic, inexpensive and suitable for Social Media analysis. © 2015 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a study on natural expressive speech during public talks. Specifically, we focus on how people convey important messages that may be retained in the audience's consciousness. Our study aims to answer several questions. Why are some public speeches memorable and inspirational for the audience, while others are not? Why are some memorable/inspirational spoken quotes more popular than others? Being able to evaluate why certain spoken words are memorable/inspirational is not a trivial matter, and most studies on memorable quote detection are only limited to textual data. In this study, we use both linguistic and acoustic features of public speeches in TED talks. The results reveal that based on those linguistic and acoustic features, we are able to distinguish memorable spoken quotes and non-memorable spoken quotes with 70.4% accuracy.

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, investigations of Sentiment Analysis over a well-known Social Media Twitter were done. As literatures show that some works related to Twitter Sentiment Analysis have been done and delivered interesting idea of features, but there is no a comparative study that shows the best features in performing Sentiment Analysis. In total we used 9 feature sets (41 attributes) that comprise punctuation, lexical, part of speech, emoticon, SentiWord lexicon, AFINN-lexicon, Opinion lexicon, Senti-Strength method, and Emotion lexicon. Feature analysis was done by conducting supervised classification for each feature sets and continued with feature selection in subjectivity and polarity domain. By using four different datasets, the results reveal that AFINN lexicon and Senti-Strength method are the best current approaches to perform Twitter Sentiment Analysis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Research on recommendation system is now getting a lot of attention due to the rapid growth of user generated contents, especially internet review forums. They easily share about their experiences towards some products and services on the review forums. As a result, review forums are overwhelmed with the amount valuable information for predicting user interests. In our work, we present a method to develop a recommendation system leveraging the information mined from review forums. Our method automatically determines user interests by learning from user reviews. Furthermore, we propose the notion of 'considered aspects' as the form of user interests, which serve as key information why users are interested in consuming a specific product or service. Several state-of-the-art methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are employed to extract those 'considered aspects'. Finally, we show that our recommendation system significantly outperforms the baseline system. It is also worth noting that our proposed method is completely unsupervised, domain-independent, and language-independent. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As one of the largest Social Media in providing public data every day, Twitter has attracted the attention of researcher to investigate, in order to mine public opinion, which is known as Sentiment Analysis. Consequently, many techniques and studies related to Sentiment Analysis over Twitter have been proposed in recent years. However, there is no study that discuss about sentence pattern of positive/negative sentence and neither subjective/objective sentence. In this paper we propose POS sequence as feature to investigate pattern or word combination of tweets in two domains of Sentiment Analysis: subjectivity and polarity. Specifically we utilize Information Gain to extract POS sequence in three forms: sequence of 2-tags, 3-tags, and 5-tags. The results reveal that there are some tendencies of sentence pattern which distinguish between positive, negative, subjective and objective tweets. Our approach also shows that feature of POS sequence can improve Sentiment Analysis accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper explores the use of auditory features based on cochleograms; two dimensional speech features derived from gammatone filters within the convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Furthermore, we also propose various possibilities to combine cochleogram features with log-mel filter banks or spectrogram features. In particular, we combine within low and high levels of CNN framework which we refer to as low-level and high-level feature combination. As comparison, we also construct the similar configuration with deep neural network (DNN). Performance was evaluated in the framework of hybrid neural network - hidden Markov model (NN-HMM) system on TIMIT phoneme sequence recognition task. The results reveal that cochleogram-spectrogram feature combination provides significant advantages. The best accuracy was obtained by high-level combination of two dimensional cochleogram-spectrogram features using CNN, achieved up to 8.2% relative phoneme error rate (PER) reduction from CNN single features or 19.7% relative PER reduction from DNN single features. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In community-based question answering (CQA) services where answers are generated by human, users may expect better answers than an automatic question answering system. However, in some cases, the user generated answers provided by CQA archives are not always of high quality. Most existing works on answer quality prediction use the same model for all answers, despite the fact that each answer is intrinsically different. However, modeling each individual QA pair differently is not feasible in practice. To balance between efficiency and accuracy, we propose a hybrid hierarchy-of-classifiers framework to model the QA pairs. First, we analyze the question type to guide the selection of the right answer quality model. Second, we use the information from question analysis to predict the expected answer features and train the type-based quality classifiers to hierarchically aggregate an overall answer quality score. We also propose a number of novel features that are effective in distinguishing the quality of answers. We tested the framework on a dataset of about 50 thousand QA pairs from Yahoo! Answer. The results show that our proposed framework is effective in identifying high quality answers. Moreover, further analysis reveals the ability of our framework to classify low quality answers more accurately than a single classifier approach. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we present the construction and analysis of memorable spoken quote corpora from TED public speaking. Memorable quotes are interesting and useful words which usually contain generic pearls of wisdom that could achieve public awareness and retained in people consciousness. Our study aims to reveal why can some public speeches can be retained in people mind and make their consciousness to like and share it, while some others can not. To achieve this purpose, the relevance corpora is required to perform system quantitative evaluation. In this study, we start with the collection of the corpus from TED public speaking. Specifically, we utilize 899 video files of TED Talks and more than 2000 speech quotes annotated by TED team. We then complement the data with non-memorable quotes. According to shares number of quotes which are provided by TED, we also annotate memorable quotes with popularity factor. Analysis of memorable spoken quotes is done based on speech duration, F0, and popularity. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we address the problem of automatic speech summarization on open-domain TED talks. The large vocabulary and diversity of topics from speaker-to-speaker presents significant difficulties. The challenges increase not only how to handle disfluencies and fillers, but also how to extract topic-related meaningful messages within the free talks. Here, we propose to incorporate semantic and acoustic features within the speech summarization technique. In addition, we also propose a new evaluation method for speech summarization by checking semantic similarity between system and human summarization. Experiments results reveal that the proposed methods are effective in spontaneous speech summarization. © 2014 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Ass.</dc:abstract>

We use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as a feature extracted from the songs. The music instrument identification is done by applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm as a classification method on various numbers of instruments and duration of the Indonesian folksongs. The experiment results show that music instrument identification performs better using the classification method. The folksongs that are played using 2 instruments are highly recognized than folksongs that are played using 3 and 4 music instruments. The music instrument identification results are also influenced by the music duration. The music instruments are easily identified in songs that have 2 second duration rather than 4-second and 6-second duration. © 2012 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we study whether a question and its answer can be related using analogical reasoning by using various kinds of textual occurrences in a question answering (QA) task. We argue that in a QA passage retrieval context, low cost language features can contribute some positive influence in the representation of the information need that also appears in other passages, which have some analogical features. We attempt to leverage this through query expansion and query stopwords exchange strategies among analogical question answer pairs, which are modeled by a Bayesian Analogical Reasoning framework. Our study by using ResPubliQA 2009 and 2010 dataset shows that the predicted analogical relation between question answer pairs can be used to maintain the information need of the QA passage retrieval task, but has a poor performance in determining the question type. Our best accuracy score was achieved by using'bigram occurrences by using stemmer and TF-IDF weighting completed with named-entity' feature set for the query expansion approach, and 'bigram occurrences by using stemmer and TF-IDF weighting' feature set for the stopwords exchanged approach. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In a question answering system (QAS), question analysis component has an important task to determine the expected answer type (EAT) of a given question. Many QAS's rely their question analysis performance on manually developed patterns, such as in Open Ephyra (OE), one of a state of the art freely available QAS. Recently, there are a number of studies which investigated the influence of statistical relational framework to learn question-answer pairs in particular component of a QAS. In this study, we propose an approach that utilizes the intensity of statistical learning of question-answer pairs as a means to develop EAT patterns. In a question analysis experiment setting by using factoid testing questions from QA@CLEF 2008, our result outperforms the accuracy of manually constructed patterns of OE, with 84.17% against 81.67%. © 2011 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This year we participated in the English monolingual paragraph selection task at ResPubliQA 2010. Our general strategy is to find the supporting word context from query and candidate passages during the paragraph selection. We use the techniques of state-of-the art publicly available question answering systems, i.e. Open Ephyra and JIRS, and the random projection implementation in the Semantic Vectors package to evaluate the word context. To strengthen the paragraph selection, besides the context evaluation, we also use n-gram overlapping and textual containment. Our approach has a c@1 measure of 0.73 for our pattern-based context configuration and 0.64 for our n-gram-based context configuration.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Availability of enormous number of digital music presents challenge to organize and retrieve it in an effective way. We explore polyphonic Indonesian folksongs retrieval based on pattern matching such as n-gram in searching the songs. We compare the pattern matching results to regular text-based information retrieval system. The folksongs are either fully or partially indexed. The results of the experiments show that using text-based IR system or n-gram matching technique, both are effective in retrieving the polyphonic songs, regardless of the query length or position where the query fragment is taken. However, to achieve a better performance, fully indexed songs is preferable than partially indexed songs. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Our research focuses on Geographic Information Retrieval for Indonesian documents. We constructed a Geographical Gazeeter for geographic locations based on information that we collected from the Geographic resources. We used the table to identify the locations of events that are mentioned in the documents. We added a location index associated with each document. We also identified the possible locations based on words that indicate the relative position to locations mentioned in the queries. The result of our experiments showed that the location index and the processing of words indicating relative positions improved the retrieval performance of natural language queries. Applying the query expansion techniques by adding keywords and locations from the documents to the queries resulted in significant performance improvement.</dc:abstract>

This year we compare the use of several language resources to translate Indonesian queries into English. We used several readable machine dictionaries to perform the translation. We also used two machine translation techniques to translate the Indonesian queries. In addition to translating an Indonesian query set into English, we also translated English documents into Indonesian using the machine readable dictionaries and a commercial machine translation tool. The results show performing the task by translating the queries is better than translating the documents. Combining several dictionaries produced better result than only using one dictionary. However, the query expansion that we applied to the translated queries using the dictionaries reduced the retrieval effectiveness of the queries. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we identify location names that appear in queries written in Indonesian using geographic gazeeter. We built the gazeeter by collecting geographic information from a number of geographic resources. We translated an Indonesian query set into English using a machine translation technique. We also made an attempt to improve the retrieval effectiveness using a query expansion technique. The result shows that identifying locations in the queries and applying the query expansion technique can help improve the retrieval effectiveness for certain queries.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we describe our experiments in finding answers from documents based on statistical and linguistic knowledge. We collected the candidate answers from sources available on the internet, and then we used them to validate the answers found in the documents. The candidate answers from the documents were found using a statistical technique and linguistic knowledge such as named entity tags to find the type of answer that matches the question category.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a report on our participation in the Indonesian-English ad hoc bilingual task of the 2006 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). This year we compare the use of several language resources to translate Indonesian queries into English. We used several readable machine dictionaries to perform the translation. We also used two machine translation techniques to translate the Indonesian queries. In addition to translating an Indonesian query set into English, we also translated English documents into Indonesian using the machine readable dictionaries and a commercial machine translation tool. The results show performing the task by translating the queries is better than translating the documents. Combining several dictionaries produced better result than only using one dictionary. However, the query expansion that we applied to the translated queries using the dictionaries reduced the retrieval effectiveness of the queries.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We present a report on our participation in the English-Dutch bilingual task of the 2001 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). We attempted to demonstrate that good cross language query translation results can be obtained by combining a dictionary based and parallel corpus based techniques. A parallel corpus based technique was used to choose the best sense from all possible senses found in the dictionary. However, our results demonstrate that a pure dictionary based technique produces the best query translation than a parallel corpus based and the combined techniques. We also show that improvement in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained using a query expansion technique. Copyright © 2001 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This report describes the work done for our participation in the multilingual track of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). We use a dictionary-based approach to translate English queries into German, French and Italian queries. We then apply a term disambiguation technique to select the best translation terms from terms found in the dictionary entries, and a query expansion technique to enhance the queries’ retrieval performance. We show that the word-formation characteristics of different languages affect the effectiveness of statistical techniques in dealing with the ambiguity problem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>With the increasing availability of machine-readable bilingual dictionaries, dictionary-based automatic query translation has become a viable approach to Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). In this approach, resolving term ambiguity is a crucial step. We propose a sense disambiguation technique based on a term-similarity measure for selecting the right translation sense of a query term. In addition, we apply a query expansion technique which is also based on the term similarity measure to improve the effectiveness of the translation queries. The results of our Indonesian to English and English to Indonesian CLIR experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the sense disambiguation technique. As for the query expansion technique, it is shown to be effective as long as the term ambiguity in the queries has been resolved. In the effort to solve the term ambiguity problem, we discovered that differences in the pattern of word-formation between the two languages render query translations from one language to the other difficult. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We propose a query expansion technique which is based on a statistical similarity measure among terms to improve the effectiveness of the dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) method. We employ a term similarity-based sense disambiguation technique proposed in our earlier work to enhance the accuracy of the dictionary-based query translation method. The query expansion technique is then applied to the translation of queries to further improve their retrieval performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two techniques combined using queries in three languages, namely, German, Spanish, and Indonesian, to retrieve English documents from a standard TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) collection. The results of our experiments indicate that the term similarity-based techniques work better when there are more phrases in the queries. In addition, our results also re-emphasize other researchers’ finding that phrase recognition and translation are critical to CLIR’s effectiveness. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Multimodal distribution makes classification more challenging. In some cases, it will cause a decrease in performance of the classifier. Therefore, we must select and utilize an appropriate classifier for this kind of data. In addition, multimodal distribution causes classification result of single-codebook-based classifiers fail to classify the data accurately. Some research has been conducted to build multicodebook-based classifier. In this study, we propose an enhancement of Multicodebook Fuzzy Neuro Generalized Learning Vector Quantization method using Intelligent K-Means clustering based on Histogram Information. First, We used Intelligent K-Means Clustering using histogram information as the number of cluster parameter. Next, We applied the clustering method to FNGLVQ in order to generate codebook candidate before the training process. The experiment is conducted using synthetic and benchmark datasets. Overall, the proposed method achieved a better accuracy compared to multi codebook FNGLVQ using IK-Means clustering based on anomalous pattern and original FNGLVQ with a margin of 4.14% and 17.29% respectively. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Model-Based Machine Learning is an approach in which every assumption related to the problem domain is explicitly represented. Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) is one of its applications combining probabilistic and graphical approach. PGM application in sequential prediction problems is useful to keep the prediction in the track. A conditional version of PGM, Continuous Conditional Random Fields is discussed in this work. CCRF boosts the baseline predictor(s) that can be any conventional machine learning, such as artificial neural network, tree, and other predictors or regressor. CCRF can capture the relationship between individual predictions made by the baseline predictor(s) at different steps, yet those steps need not necessarily to be consecutive to each other. It allows CCRF to explore the time series sequence characteristic even much deeper, especially if the time series is seasonal. The experiment result show that CCRF can proportionally alleviate the error rate of its baseline by improving the baseline up to 54%. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Precision Agriculture using mobile robot aimed to increase efficiency and quality of crops treatment and monitoring, since robot can produce better result in term of data quality and accuracy than manual treatment by human labor. Limited by technology development and complexity of agricultural environment, precision agriculture nowadays is still not fully-autonomous, but partially autonomous to handle more simpler - but need high accuracy - tasks. Some of them is mapping and monitoring task. This research proposed a method for generating map in simulated agricultural area using Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), by generating grid-based/volumetric map using fine-tuned SLAM-Gmapping algorithm and combine it with properties/informations obtained from each detected crops/plants using fruit detection with visual sensor and tree location detection using 2D laser scanner sensor. Experiment conducted in simulation environment Gazebo and Robot Operation System (ROS) for scenario of simulated fruit mapping in apple farm, and give a good result with a good accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Software Project Scheduling Problem (SPSP) is one of Project Scheduling Problem which is classified as NP-Hard problem. In 2014, variation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms was successfully developed. The algorithm is Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) that proposed to solve SPSP. In 2012, there is variation of ACO named Ant Colony Extended (ACE) developed for Travelling Salesman Problem and it shows better performance than well-known ACO algorithms: MMAS and Ant Colony System (ACS). However, there is no research about ACE's performance in SPSP where MMAS is successfully applied. In this paper, ACE and MMAS algorithm were compared in SPSP. The experiment result shows that ACE has better performance than MMAS for SPSP. The performance is indicated by fitness value of the algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the era of Big Data, data size and data security are issues that need to be solved. To address this problem, we may apply data compression technique or data encryption. On the other hand, the coding based method may be other solution. The coding based method may learn data distribution and reduce data dimension with minimized the loss of information from the original data. Stacked Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machine (Stacked US-ELM) is one of the fastest methods which can be used to address it. The problem is how many stacks we need to get the optimal performance of the classifier. In this research, we inspected the performance of Stacked Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machine (US-ELM) for enhancing classifier performance and proposed a new method. The proposed method is a loop scheme of Stacked US-ELM to optimize the number of stacks of US-ELM. We conducted the experiment using ECG-sleep dataset, synthetic dataset, and Glass dataset. To measure the performance of Stacked US-ELM and the proposed method, we conducted classification according to our data sets using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The 5-Folds Cross Validation is used to evaluate the performance. We compared the result of the classification without US-ELM with the fix Stacked US-ELM and the proposed method. The results showed the proposed method achieved the best performance over Stacked US-ELM in all dataset. The mean of accuracies of the proposed method are 64,39%, 76,24%, 63,22%, and 69, 61% on 4 class ECG-sleep dataset, 3 class ECG-sleep dataset, skewed synthetic dataset, and glass dataset. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

These classifier tools are WEKA classifier, MoA (Massive Online Analysis) classifier, and SPARK MLib that runs on Hadoop infrastructure. We tested the traffic data using decision trees because it is one of the best methods for regressing the large data. The experiment results showed that the WEKA classifier fails to classify dataset with a large number of instance, wheras the MoA has successfully regress the dataset as a datastream. The SPARK MLib decision trees algorithm could also successfully resgress the traffic data quickly with a fairly good accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the recent years, the volume of data that exists in the world has risen dramatically. Biomedical data are data that are recorded from a living being that is used to help analyzing and diagnosis of a certain illness. Like many other types of data, the volume biomedical data has also risen in the last couple of years. In order to process this large amount of data, conventional processing techniques are not adequate. In this paper, we discuss several approach in processing large amount of biomedical data. This paper will also discuss several variations of biomedical data and the challenge that are faced when processing those biomedical data in large sizes. We also proposed integrated Telehealth system which combine Tele-ECG, Tele-USG, and existing biomedical application. The system will be implemented on Big Data Framework. Then Tele-health development can be done using the phase that we propose. The system is started by developing end-to-end user system, implementation to Big Data Framework, then it is finished by Clinical Practice. The proposed framework can be used for high standard biomedical system. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The number of maternal and infant mortality in Indonesia is high due to the lack of fetal monitoring. In addition, the number of Obstetrics and Gynecology is limited and it centralized in urban area. In order to resolve that problem, we have built fetal head monitoring system. In this work we examine Particle Swarm Optimization for Gaussian Elliptical Path in automatic fetal head approximation. Particle Swarm Optimization is employ for optimizing ellipse fitting optimization in Gaussian Elliptical Path.

	<dc:abstract>Fire-fighting robot is still one of the fields in robotic competitions held these days. This paper is aimed to see the implementation of the Markov Decision Planning (MDP) problem in a fire-fighting robot's navigation. The MDP algorithm evolves planning of the actions the robot should take according to the policy. This planning is mapped into a grid map. Yet in the implementation, this planning is applied in a continuous map. Using a fire-fighting robot the succession of this planning implementation is undertaken. The result shows that the implementation of grid mapped in a continuous map yields significant impacts that lead the MDP to be able to solve the limitation of wall following algorithm. This algorithm is also applied in the real autonomous mobile robot. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia is developing country with high population. There are more than 200 million residents living in the country. As a developing country, Indonesia has several health problems. First, Indonesia has a high value of mortality caused by heart and cardio vascular diseases. One of the major cause is the lack of medical checkup especially for heart monitoring. It is caused by limited number of medical instrumentation e.g. ECG in hospital and public health center. The supporting factor is the small number of cardiologist in Indonesia. There are 365 cardiologists across the country, which is a very small number compared to the 200 million of Indonesia population. Furthermore, they are not distributed evenly in all provinces, but only centered in Jakarta and other capital cities. Therefore, it is difficult for residents to get appropriate heart monitoring. Second, the mortality rate of mother and baby during delivery of the baby in Indonesia is also high. One way to solve this problem is to devise a system where the health clinics in rural areas can perform fetal biometry detection before consulting the results to the expert physicians from other areas. The proposed system will be equipped with algorithms for automatic fetal detection and biometry measurement. By the end of this development, we have several results, the first is a classifier to automatic heartbeat disease prediction with accuracy more than 95%, the second is compression method based on wavelet decompositon, and the third is detection and approximation a fetus in an ultrasound image with hit rate more than 93%. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the most profound use of ultrasound imaging is fetal growth monitoring. Conventionally, physicians will perform manual measurements of several parameters of the ultrasound images to draw some conclusion of the fetal condition by manually annotating the fetal images on the ultrasound device interface. However, performing manual annotation of fetal images will require significant amount of time considering the number of patients an obstetrician can have. In this paper, an integrated automatic system for fetal growth monitoring and detection is proposed. This system will be able to automatically measuring the parameters of fetal head, abdomen, femur, and humerus. In addition to automated image detection, we also propose an integrated telehealth monitoring system to provide better access of ultrasound monitoring for patients that lives in rural areas. A new approach of fetal image detection is also proposed by using AdaBoost. MH boosting algorithm that is combined with an improved efficient Hough Transform for detecting ellipse-like organs such as head and abdomen. Experiments of the method are tested on real ultrasound image dataset. The detection was applied on 2D ultrasound images to perform fetal object measurement to approximate the Head Circumference (HC) and Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Femur Length (FL), and Humerus Length (HL).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the most profound use of ultrasound imaging is to generate the image of fetal during pregnancy. This paper will describe an ellipse detection approach to automatically detect and approximate the head size of the fetal. The method was developed using the Hough Transform techniques that have been modified and optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Experiments of the method are tested on synthetic and real ellipse image dataset. For real images, the detection was applied on 2D ultrasonography images to perform fetal head measurement to approximate the Head Circumference (HC) and Biparietal Diameter (BPD). Experiment result showed that the proposed method can perform ellipse detection in synthetic dataset with satisfactory result for noisy images with noise density up to 0.4 and able to perform the fetal head detection for real images with an averate hit rate of 0.654. This proposed method can also perform detection on images that have high degree of noise or incomplete ellipse images generated from the fetal objects. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Segmentation of fetal organs such as head, femur, and humérus on ultrasound image is one of the challenges in realization of automated system for fetal biometry measurements. Although many methods have been developed to overcome this problem, most of them are generally specific to one organ of the body alone. The research in this paper will focus on a machine learning method that has been available before: multilayer super pixel classification using random forest. The focus of this study is to improve the accuracy by exploring compactness parameter in the formation of super-pixels. In addition, we also add moment image features such as translation, rotation, and scale invariant to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results showed that the difference in compactness parameters will provide different result for the accuracy, Fl-score, recall, and specificity. The addition of moment features can also improve the performance of image segmentation of fetal organs even though increase was not significant. Fetal head segmentation using proposed method has higher Fl-score and specificity, but lower accuracy and recall compared to previous methods. Whereas fetal femur and humérus segmentation using proposed method has higher accuracy, Fl-score, recall and specificity compared to previous method. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cancer is one kind of deadly disease. Colorectal carcinoma is one type of cancer which is difficult to detect in its early stage. It has dangerous malignancy in its advance stage. Identify gene expressed and cancer linked to phenotype is an effort to identify and analyze correlation of genes and clinical phenotype (metastasis). In this paper Intelligent K-Means is used to cluster genes expression. It is a non parametric clustering that more powerful and more stable than GMM clustering which is used in previous research. After getting clusters of genes, then correlation ratio is used to identify whether genes in a cluster has a correlation with clinical metastasis. As the result in this paper, genes in cluster C and cluster E have correlation with normal-cancer tissue metastasis and distant metastasis. But, there is no cluster of genes has correlation with lymph node metastasis. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or quad copter robot for object localization and tracking has been developed. The robot is potentially utilized for military purpose, i.e. doing patrol continuously especially in frontier area. In other words, the UAV is proposed to carry out patrol and exploration by exploring coverage area, find, localize and track suspicious objects. The swarm robots are equipped with Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm for intelligent feature. PSO is an optimization algorithm where each agent of swarm will use its individual perception (local base) and community perception (global base). This swarm quad copter system was implemented using Robot Operating System (ROS) Framework. Experiment was conducted with 3 quadcopter agents and one object as the target. Two main scenarios have been exercised, i.e. a scenario with steady target and another one with moving target. Experimental result shows that Modified PSO implemented in this system has better performance compared to fully random based moving algorithm for object localization and tracking. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An intuitive control system based on gesture recognition for humanoid robot has been developed. The gesture of a human operator can be recognized successfully with 99.87% accuracy using Fuzzy Neural Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (FNGLVQ) algorithm. A total of 13 distinct gestures were trained onto the system to represent 13 different actions. The system maps the recognized gestures to 13 different sequences of movements which will be executed by the humanoid robot. This system can be used in settings where tele-operation of humanoid robot is needed. The use of gestures to give commands to humanoid robot will decrease the learning curve of the operator by providing a more intuitive control mechanism. This system eliminate the need to memorize a set of complex procedures. Another possible application is for teaching children with autism basic social interaction as a complement for human tutor. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Countries such as Indonesia and Japan are prone to disasters. Telecommunication infrastructure are often damaged as a result of disasters, while reliable communication link is vital in search and rescue operation following a disaster. To overcome this problem, we developed swarm quadrotor robots capable of self-deployment and extending the coverage of available Wi-Fi network. Since most hand-held devices now has Wi-Fi connectivity, most device can join the network the quadrotors created. The quadrotor robot is based on Parrot ARDrone quadrotor with Wi-Fi adapters and added GPS module. This research focuses only on the self-deployment movement algorithm of the quadrotors which is based on Takahashi's distributed self-deployment algorithm. The implementation of routing protocol will be done in the next step of the research. © 2012 SICE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Traffic plays an important role in social stability and community development. Without an appropriate traffic signal control system, the possibility of traffic congestion will be very high and causes various negative impacts. The traffic signal control system with video camera sensor is implemented in embedded systems using BeagleBoard-xM. The system uses Viola-Jones method and Haar Training in detecting the vehicle object from a video frame. Then, Euclidean distance and kalman filter methods are used in tracking the vehicle. The ability of kalman filter in predicting the next position of the object is a very important feature for multi-object tracking. The number of counted vehicles in each lane at the intersection then will be processed using Fuzzy Logic to determine optimal cycle time and split time. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many algorithms in workflow scheduling and resource provisioning rely on the performance estimation of tasks to produce a scheduling plan. A profiler that is capable of modeling the execution of tasks and predicting their runtime accurately, therefore, becomes an essential part of any Workflow Management System (WMS). With the emergence of multi-tenant Workflow as a Service (WaaS) platforms that use clouds for deploying scientific workflows, task runtime prediction becomes more challenging because it requires the processing of a significant amount of data in a near real-time scenario while dealing with the performance variability of cloud resources. Hence, relying on methods such as profiling tasks' execution data using basic statistical description (e.g., mean, standard deviation) or batch offline regression techniques to estimate the runtime may not be suitable for such environments. In this paper, we propose an online incremental learning approach to predict the runtime of tasks in scientific workflows in clouds. To improve the performance of the predictions, we harness fine-grained resources monitoring data in the form of time-series records of CPU utilization, memory usage, and I/O activities that are reflecting the unique characteristics of a task's execution. We compare our solution to a state-of-the-art approach that exploits the resources monitoring data based on regression machine learning technique. From our experiments, the proposed strategy improves the performance, in terms of the error, up to 29.89%, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. ©2018 IEEE</dc:abstract>

Contour detection applied to define the object from its candidate. Vehicle is determined using threshold area of contour properties. The detected vehicles is tracked using an adaptive distance similarity measurement. Then, vehicle will be counted using the counting line after its vehicles pass that line. The proposed method is tested in four datasets with different challenges such as differences in light, weather, camera vibration, and image blurring. The research obtains satisfactory results especially in noon and rainy dataset with the accuracy higher than 93% for vehicle detection, tracking, and counting. The proposed method is able to detect, perform tracking, and counting the number of vehicles in a real time for highway videos. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The use of cloud computing, particularly of Infrastructure as a Service clouds, for the execution of largescale scientific workflows has been a topic of interest in recent years. These environments offer on-demand access to all of the infrastructure required for the deployment of workflows, allowing users to pay only for what they use. This leads to schedulers having to find a trade-off between two conflicting quality of service requirements: Time and cost. The majority of research in this area has focused on developing scheduling algorithms that have as objective minimizing the infrastructure cost while meeting a deadline constraint. Few algorithms, however, have addressed the problem of minimizing the execution time of the workflow while meeting a budget constraint. This paper focuses on the latter case. We propose a budget-distribution algorithm that assigns a portion of the overall workflow budget to the individual tasks. This task-level budget then guides the dynamic scheduling process and is continuously refined to reflect any unexpected costs. When compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm, the performance evaluation results demonstrate that in 88% of the cases, our proposal achieves equal or better performance in terms of meeting the budget constraint and achieves lower execution times in 84% of the cases. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Compression still become main concern in big data framework. The performance of big data depend on speed of data transfer. Compressed data can speed up transfer data between network. It also save more space for storage. Several compression method is provide by Hadoop as a most common big data framework. That method mostly for general purpose. But the performance still have to optimize especially for Biomedical record like ECG data. We propose Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) for big data compression with study case ECG signal data. In this paper compression will run in Hadoop Framework. The proposed method has stages such as input signal, map input signal, spiht coding, and reduce bit-stream. The compression produce compressed data for intermediate (Map) output and final (reduce) output. The experiment using ECG data to measure compression performance. The proposed method gets Percentage Root-mean-square difference (PRD) is about 1.0. Compare to existing method, the proposed method get better Compression Ratio (CR) with competitive longer compression time. So proposed method gets better performance compare to other method especially for ECG dataset. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One factor of human sperm health is sperm motility. Motility is the ability of sperm to move. Sperm with healthy motility move forward promptly, not inactive and not moving in circles. In this paper, we would like to analyse sperm motility by considering the problem of multi object tracking in video sequences of human sperms. The challenges in multi-sperm tracking are many human sperms have fast and unpredictable movement In addition, the sperm have similar size and shape comparing by each others. To solve this problem, we used sperm detection in each video sequence to get the position of sperms. In the same time, the estimated sperm position is calculated based on previous tracking by using Kalman Filter. Finally the positions of detected sperms are compared to estimation results by using Hungarian assignment method. In this way, the trajectory of each sperm can be conclude. This paper analyze sperm motility qualitatively based on the resulted sperm trajectories. The experiment results were conducted on both open video data and our own low-frame-rate video data. The experiment results shows that the proposed method can handle the challenges in multi sperm tracking, create their trajectory and then analyze their behaviors. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In Indonesia, interbank money transfer amount and volume are very large. For each interbank money transfer, customer are charged with same transfer fee, regardless the transfer amount. For customer with low and middle economy level, they found the transfer fee quite a burden to deal with when they need to do interbank money transfer for several times per month with small amount. Flip.id came with the offer to do interbank money transfer free of charge for limited amount per day. The purpose of this study is to identify the reason of customers to use Flip.id services based on rational consumer behavior analysis. According to this study, it is known that the efficiency of using the application with significant cost reduction and the easiness of getting/spreading the information of transfer order that been done, become a major factor on why customer chose Flip.id to do interbank money transfer. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

In this research, data was collected from a reputable manufacturing organization in Indonesia. A total of 59 individuals from the organization participated in this research actively use ERP in their daily work activities. The qualitative data was then statistically analyzed by using PLS-SEM. The results provided insights into how collaborative factors shape users' perception of usefulness and ease of use, which in turn affects their behavioral intention to use ERP. Attitude towards use was affected by usefulness and ease of use perceived, whereas behavioral intention towards use was affected by usefulness perceived. Internal collaboration affected both perceived usefulness and ease of use. On the other hand, external collaboration was deemed as insignificant contributors in shaping users' perceived of usefulness and ease of use. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study investigated the effects of negative online reviews on consumers’ attitude and purchase intention, more specifically in relation to popular products. The investigation took into account the proportion of negative online reviews (low and high) and their quality (low and high), as well as comparing their impact in relation to popular and unpopular products. As a control variable, a website was purposely developed to suit eight different experimental treatments and their manipulations. This study involved 382 participants, who were exposed to the specially created website and asked to perform a specific task. Their responses were captured via questionnaires. The results showed that consumers’ positive attitude to popular products decreased as the proportion of negative online reviews increased. The quality of reviews was found to have a less significant influence on consumer responses. Furthermore, this research revealed that unpopular products were more affected by negative online reviews than popular ones. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Technology and tourism sector continues to grow encouraging the birth of E-tourism concept. E-tourism concept is widely adopted by travel agents in marketing various tour packages. Currently, there is a C2C Marketplace adoption in E-tourism that provides a variety of open trip travel packages. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that affect individuals in ordering an open trip tour package through open trip marketplace site. Specifically, this study looks at from two perspectives perceived value of perceived quality and perceived risk of open trip marketplace site. Data collection in this study was conducted by distributing questionnaires online. This study processed data obtained from 58 respondents who have used the open trip marketplace site through the application of smartPLS 3.0. The results of the study concluded that the intention of individuals to buy tour packages through open-trip marketplace sites is only directly affected by the perceived quality of the open-trip marketplace site and indirectly influenced by efficiency. While perceived value is influenced strongly by perceived quality and perceived risk. Then the perceived risk of the open-trip marketplace site is only affected by privacy and is not affected by trust. © 2019 IEEE. All Rights Reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The aim of this research was to discover the stances of individual elements as antecedents of mobile payment usage. Data was gathered by distributing a questionnaire, which in latter steps was analyzed quantitatively. This research collected 90 samples, of whom represented users of a mobile payment service in Indonesia. The collected dataset was statistically analyzed, by employing partial least square structural equational modelling (PLS-SEM), aided with SmartPLS3.0. The results showed that two types of individual factors, namely individual difference and behavioral belief played significant roles in shaping users’ intention to use mobile payments. Individual differences, consisting of mobile payment knowledge and compatibility significantly influenced perceived ease of use. Behavioral belief, such as trust, was shown to significantly influenced perceived usefulness. Finally, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness concertedly affected mobile payment users’ intention to use. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The rapid growth of Internet users becomes an opportunity for e-commerce company to develop its business. However, there are challenges which e-commerce company have to face. Indonesia, despite having a significant growth of its Internet users, only 27% of its Internet users who have already used online shopping. The participation of Indonesian society can be enforced by providing social interaction in e-commerce. This triggers the emergence of e-commerce business model in the form of social commerce, which emphasizes on its social interaction. The social interaction drives customers experience, so they are willing to participate in online purchasing activities. This study uses three forms of experience that can be perceived by its customers, namely social support, social presence, and flow. The analysis result of 308 respondents demonstrate that social commerce constructs have influence to customer experiences. Meanwhile, customer experiences have influence to social shopping and sharing intention. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research aims to identify whether small, medium and large organisations employ different approaches in achieving IT and business alignment. The strategic alignment maturity (SAM) model was utilised as the basis for evaluation. The respondents of this research were 107 different organisations representing small, medium and large businesses with diverse industry backgrounds ranging from those in creative industries to those in manufacturing, computing, and even telecommunication providers. Through six different ANOVA tests, this research has confirmed that organisations of different scales significantly differ in the way they approach alignment. Furthermore, this research looked deeper using multiple comparisons and analysed whether the three organisational scales employ the SAM model dimensions and their attributes differently. The results were akin, in almost all cases, small and medium sized organisations shared the same approaches towards attaining alignment with each other, and differed when compared to the approaches of large organisations. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>PT XYZ, which is formed in mid-2013, is responsible for the five business units in marine logistics services. The company wants to have good governance and standardized documents according to the needs of each management system used in the corresponding business unit. However, the different types, characteristics and processes of the business units and the lack of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) acceptance drives the initiative to propose a strategy for ECM implementation. This study uses Soft System Methodology (SSM) approach in ECM implementation strategy combined with supporting theories namely content maturity models and content audit. This research resulted in 24 activities derived from the 14 major activities in the conceptual model. These 24 activities are transformed into ECM implementation strategy. This implementation strategy can be used as the baseline for PT XYZ to pursue its ECM implementation until the end of 2015. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

More than ever, customers are considered as knowledge, leading to insights, innovations, and new ideas within a company. Knowledge acquisition, such as customer knowledge, is proven to be very difficult. This leads us to explore further concerning customer knowledge acquisition. Customer knowledge itself consists of knowledge 'from', 'for', and 'about' customers. This research is aimed to analyze the impacts of the three customer knowledge types towards knowledge management benefits, which in turn will affect a company's performance. Business processes, customers, employees, finance, products, and market are six-aspects used to measure knowledge management benefits. This research had collected questionnaires from 50 respondents consisting of major banks and insurance companies in Indonesia. Then the verified data was analyzed using PLS technique. The results show that knowledge 'for' customers is most favorable towards knowledge management benefits, followed by knowledge 'from' customers, while knowledge 'about' customers is found to give minimum impact towards knowledge management benefits. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>E-commerce industry in Indonesia has grown rapidly since 2012. This development is also in line with the number of transactions that uses credit cards. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is followed by credit card frauds as well. Therefore, there is an urge for a standard to be used as a main reference in protecting the security of information. Visa and MasterCard have issued an international standard to ensure the security of credit card data, namely, PCI DSS. It emphasizes the importance of protecting cardholder information in one's daily business processes. On December 2013, the latest version of this standard was released, and brought about difficulties, even to those organizations that are already compliant to previous versions of the same standard. The aim of this research is to be able to identify the changes brought about by the latest PCI DSS, namely, version 3.0. Furthermore, this research is intended to implement that very standard to measure an organization's compliance level. This research uses a case study approach in Indonesia largest company in online payment services. The results of this research are the summation of 182 new controls that are simplified for use by organizations that have complied with PCI DSS 2.0 and are preparing for PCI DSS 3.0. Additionally, we found that Company X, the object of our case study, is compliant towards 77.43% of PCI DSS 3.0 requirements. Payment card industry data security standard is considered at its earlier stages. We believe that this research is one of the first in observing the changes brought about by PCI DSS 3.0 as well as in implementing it to measure an organization's compliance level. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>According to survey that was being held by DailySocial to 2030 smartphone users in Indonesia, more than 91 percent of respondents have booked flight tickets via online with more than 86 percent of them have booked through online travel agency (OTA). Flylist is the OTA that has been created by PT Solusi Awan Indonesia and published on August 2018 with the vision to retrieve 20 percent of the cheapest price that has not been sold by premium and non-premium airlines and reduce the risk of losing the chances of selling, refund, and overbooking processg. Flylist's vision is relatively huge and will be difficult for new system. To achieve it, data maturity and management should be assessed. Paper will discuss OTA theory, framework (DMBOK and other framework by James M. B.), IATA theory and inovation, research data from interviewees, and document study that will be assessed with HESA data maturity assessment.Based on data maturity assessment, we found that overall score is level 3 (proactive) with the result is Flylist can be improved by doing recommended data governance, standards compliance, data architecture management and NDC theory on customer service contact, communication, and business intelligence system, technology, data security management activity. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>As an effort to shorten supply chain and improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the procurement process, Indonesian government created a public procurementplan information system (SIRUP) as a part of e-Procurement used by government institutions in Indonesia. This research was conducted to analyze the determinant factors of SIRUP implementation in Indonesia and its impact to procurementpersonnelperformance by usingmodifiedresearch modelfromDeLone &amp;McLean theory, Task Technology Fit (TTF) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The research modelwas tested usingPartialLeastSquare Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach with SmartPLS 3.0 software. The resulto fthis research with 239 respondents shows that system quality, information quality, service quality, usage, user satisfaction, subjective norm, task characteristic andtask technology fit become factors influencing SIRUP implementation toward procurementpersonnelperformance. However, only task technology fit and user satisfaction dominantly affect the performance of procurementpersonnel. In the end, this research couldbe afeedback to Policy Institute for Procurement of Goods/Services (LKPP) as a main stakeholder of SIRUP in order to improve their system and service quality. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An alternative approach for measuring object-oriented (OO) software quality has been proposed by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) scheme. This approach is effective in defining the rank of software quality over a number of Java applications based on two sets of metric values representing main OO structural properties. The Metrics for Object-Oriented Software Engineering (MOOSE) and Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (MOOD) that have been describing individual characteristic of OO property now are integrated by means of AHPs pairwise comparison to deliver an estimate quantitative value of OO software design quality. A series of experiments were conducted by applying the approach to students works in Fundamental of Programming class. The results of applying AHP scheme were compared to experts judgments for verification. The result demonstrates the solidity of AHP mechanism for the intended purpose of measuring OO design quality. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A performance evaluation on modified structure of square operation in an inverter architecture of Galois Field (GF) has been conducted. The most time-consuming GF multiplicative inversion process has been implemented by constructing a nested square and multiplication operations. The new structure of square operator takes advantage of Normal Basis (NB) representation of GF elements. Although NB parallel multiplication has higher complexity than Polynomial Basis (PB) version, the nature of simple circular shift in NB square operation has reduced the total delay significantly and increased the inversion speed by 43% in average. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Reed Solomon Codec has been optimized by applying a new bit-level serial multiplier in the computation process of RS(15,11) 4-bit. The new multiplier took advantage of partial decoding process with fewer delay, and hence able to proceed in higher cycle rate. The RS Codec involves dominant multiplications which have been replaced by Fully Serial In Parallel Out (FSIPO) multiplier and implemented in Xilinx and Altium FPGA Board. The experiment results in throughput improvement of 11% and time efficiency of 23% in addition to automatic optimization by the synthesis tools due to the existence of constant variables in polynomial multiplications. This paper confirms that the most optimal RS Codec can be achieved by selecting the best configuration of GF arithmetic operators, each of which does not necessarily the best variant. A new perspective of GF application performance evaluation has been endorsed by the results reported in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Improving efficiency of Galois Field (GF) operators has become attention to researchers, either by reducing time or space in FPGA implementation. This paper shows that speed improvement could be achieved by applying Karatsuba-based serial multiplication in Rijndael Cipher. Throughput improvement is gained from overall performance of ciphering process instead of improvement over any single arithmetic operator. Cipher algorithm was implemented in two FPGA platforms: Xilinx and Altium and then compare the throughput obtained by every combination of processing structure and GF representation basis. The experiment shows that 20% throughput improvement is accumulated by 83% time efficiency and automated synthesis optimization due to constant variable in polynomial multiplications. This paper demonstrates significant efforts that has been put to evaluate application performance by applying all best operators versus optimal configuration. The result gives us a new insight in performance evaluation technique specifically for GF based applications. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The 2D-SPIHT of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) Telehealth system is still be a concern. The performance in the transmission process of the ECG signal data is kept being improved. The ECG signals containing a large-size of health data that must be secured. This research proposes an efficient combination of a compression and an encryption algorithms. Two-Dimension Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Tree (2D-SPIHT) used to optimally compress signals then combined with recently lightweight encryption algorithm, namely Secure IoT (SIT). This approach also proposes new effective encryption stage by just encrypt the most important information of compression signals that is beat-order. Several scenarios were conducted like encrypting the whole bit-stream and combining 2D-SPIHT with another encryption method, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The experiment result shows that proposed method gives good performance in compression and encryption. Encrypting successfully produced encrypted data that is highly different data compared to original data. Finally, the combination between 2D-SPIHT and SIT method with encrypting beat-order is the best approach. This got PRD is of 0.650 with compression-encryption-decryption time is of 83.50 seconds. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, smart devices have been rapidly developed. Most of them are just sensors and actuators without independent computation ability. The devices computation would be done in a device coordinator which need communication time between them. It makes the devices can't respond its input in the right time. Independent computation ability is needed by smart devices. Yet, its implementation has limitation in resource usage and accuracy. One of the problem for the devices accuracy is its number representation for its learning implementation. In this research we propose block and booth floating point number implementation to increase smart devices accuracy with their resource usage comparison. The research resulted FPGA components which could improve previous implemented FPGA algorithm accuracy by 17 % with two alternatives: component with minimal time consumption or component with minimal resource consumption. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In vitro fertilization technology is used to help couples get children. During the development of IVF, embryological will observe the process of cleavage embryo until it is determined which gives the highest probability to produce a pregnancy. During this division process, the observation is done manually by embryological which produce subjective assessment of an embryo and vulnerable reduced quality embryos. Embryo quality is reduced due to the observation carried out outside a developed embryo. In addition to the number of embryos that increasingly divide and have a morphology that are difficult to observe, these judgements are prone to error than the embryological own. This research proposed a method to predict the number of blastameres of the embryo time-lapse using Conditional Random Field (CRF) based on Bag of Visual Words (BoVW). BoVW approach is used to represent data with the purpose of solving the problem of subjectivity embryological votes. The data used for the experiment is the data of the human embryo from the hospital Cipto Mangun Kusumo (RSCM) and data from mouse embryos. Data embryos RSCM has more variations than data in mouse embryo. Based on the experimental results, the use of BoVW able to overcome the problem of subjectivity embryological votes with an accuracy of¿ 80%. Besides the experimental results with the proposed method uses data embryos RSCM which difficulty level is higher than the data from moose embryos, they were able to identify with both the average accuracy of 96.79%. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Outliers are one of the data problem which cannot be overlooked. The problem arise from the possibility of the outliers to become a bad data which can lead to error. One of the technique for identifying as well as eliminating outliers is generalized extreme student deviate (GESD). In this research the implementation of GESD on FPGA is examined. There are two complicated operations on GESD, i.e. division and square root which would be evaluated to find the most efficient processor design. The combination of Binomial and CORDIC has the most efficient resource utilizations with 48%. Meanwhile, the combination of Binomial and Non Restoring is the runner up with 56%. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electroencephalography (EEG) data contains electric signal activities on a cerebral cortex to record brain electrical activities. EEG signal has some characteristics such as non-periodic, non-standardized pattern, and small voltage amplitude. Hence, it is lightly heaped up to noise and difficult to recognize and extract meaningful information from EEG data. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) with various windowing methods has been widely used to mitigate noise and distortions. This paper compares and analyzes the windowing techniques in resulting the most optimal results in EEG filtration process. The experiment results show that Blackman Window gives the best result in term of the most negative value in stop-band attenuation, the widest transition bandwidth, and the highest cutoff frequency compares to Rectangular Window, Hamming Window, and Hann Window. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT &amp; LLS.

	<dc:abstract>In this progress report of our System Comprehension research, we present how one of our requirements is fulfilled. The requirement is translating one Artifact Type to other, with less depend on its type. For example we need two diagram type from a C Language source code. The source code is translated to a Sequence Diagram, and then the source code translated to other. When translating the source code into other diagram, we may reuse several part of previous translation solution (source code to sequence diagram). It reduces recurrent activities. One of its reusable component is called Concept Representation. In this paper we present two types of Concept Representation. It may use several Level of Abstraction instances, instead of use a certain Level of Abstraction. It is more sophisticated, more complex to implement in a digital system. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Various refactoring rules and their impact on class cohesion at high-level designs have been investigated. Early measurement and improvement of internal quality attributes such as cohesion, allows developers to avoid extensive review, frequent modification and rewriting of specifications, designs, and source codes. The impact of refactoring is obtained by comparing class cohesion of a design before and after refactoring applied. A set of class cohesion metrics that suits four properties of a good class cohesion metric was chosen based on theoretical analysis and supported by empirical evidence. We found that refactoring rules does not always improve class cohesion values. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

It aims to improve efficiency of ART which was claimed to have better performance than Random Testing (RT) in finding first error in a program. CB-ART is applying the concept of centroid for test case selection process. The technique for generating and computing centroid from a pool of input objects is the novelty of CB-ART. The experiment results show that our approach can generate 792.38% (near 8 times) more test cases than ARTGen and 108% more test cases than RANDOOP. Although capable in producing more test cases, the effectiveness of CB-ART is equal or higher than ARTGen and RANDOOP in some cases. We claim that our technique is able to generate high quality test case with shorter generation time. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a procedure to obtain embryo by inseminating oocyte and sperm outside human body. Several embryos are produced at the end of this procedure and it remains a problem to select the most appropriate embryo to be implanted into uterus. Many strategies have been proposed for selection of the embryo. The latest is time-lapse microscopy which monitors the embryo development continuously. An automatic method using computer to detect and locate the position of the embryo is thus needed. In this paper, an approach based on a modification of Hough Transform using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to approximate the embryo as a circle. Each PSO particle represents a circle in the parameter space and mainly used to reduce the computational complexity of Hough Transform. Experiment result showed that the proposed method is able to detect the position of the embryo accurately. The result from this method can be used to extract criteria for embryo transfer purpose. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>There are a number of ways to monitor traffic and help people to navigate through or avoid traffic jams. A prospective way is to use smart phones with GPS enabled device as traffic sensors, which complement existing sensors. This paper attempts to highlight a number of progressive steps in the effort to build an integrated ITS, which harnesses smart phones as intelligent agent. However, a number of questions should be addressed first: How smart phones can avoid map mismatching phenomenon which is a common problem in navigation devices ? What if there are compromised agents which attempt to invalidate the gathered data ? and how to place detectors in such a system. Consequently, there are three possible solutions discussed in this paper: the use of non-overlapping zones in Virtual Detection Zone (VDZ), filtering algorithm to ignore compromised agents and the use of macroscopic simulation to aid the placement of VDZ in selected roads. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A series of experiments has been conducted to show that FPGA synthesis of Galois-Field (GF) based arithmetic operators can be optimized automatically to improve Rijndael Cipher throughput. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that efficiency improvement in GF operators does not directly correspond to the system performance at application level. The experiments were motivated by so many research works that focused on improving performance of GF operators. Each of the variants has the most efficient form in either time (fastest) or space (smallest occupied area) when implemented in FPGA chips. In fact, GF operators are not utilized individually, but rather integrated one to the others to implement algorithms. Contribution of this paper is to raise issue on GF-based application performance and suggest alternative aspects that potentially affect it. Instead of focusing on GF operator efficiency, system characteristics are worth considered in optimizing application performance. © 2011 Published by LPPM ITB.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Arrhytmia is one of the most crucial problem in cardiology. It can be diagnosed by a standard electrocardiogram (ECG). So far, many methode have been develop for arrhytmia detection, recognition and classification But many methode for arrhytmia beat classification have been yet able to solve unknown category data. This paper will discusses about how to determine the type of arrhythmia in computerize way through classification process that able to solve unkown categorical beat. We use FLVQ to solve the weakness of the other methode of calssification such as to classified unknown category beat. This process is divided into three steps: data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Data preprocessing related to how the initial data prepared, in this case, we will reduce the baseline noise with cubic spline, then we cut the signal beat by beat using pivot R peak, while for the feature extraction and selection, we using wavelet algorithm. ECG signal will be classified into four classes: PVC, LBBB, NOR, RBBB and one unknown category beat; using two following algorithms Back-Propagation and Fuzzy Neuro Learning Vector Quantization (FLVQ). The classification will be devided on two phase, at ones phase we will find best fitur for out system. At this phase we use known category beat, the best fiture for out study is 50 fitur, it is from wavelet decompotition level 3. Second phase is added unkown category beat on data test, the unknown category beat is not included on data train. Accuracy of FLVQ in our study is 95.5% for data without unknown category beat at testing step and 87.6% for data with unknown category beat.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Trichloroethylene (TRI) is chlorinated solvent which has been used in various materials for industrial and daily task, such as dry-cleaners, ink composer, and medicine ingredients. It's has been known that TRI can penetrate human liver, and prolong exposure can evoke permanent damage to liver or cancer. In this research, we tried to create an automation tool that can help us analyzed and predict TRI level in human liver. The prediction will be based on liver images which analyzed using FCM, BPNNs, FLVQ, or FLVQ-PSO. In this research, the images of white mice liver that have been exposed to TRI are used. Our experiments show that the best accuracy achieved by BPNNs and 45 features from images which have been processed with KPCA. This combination accuracy is 99.12%. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Arrhythmia is a condition when heart beats are not beating properly, either in rhythm or in intensity. Sometimes arrhythmia problems could make patients in dangerous condition due to their sortie. However, good classification and diagnostic in arrhythmia will help many lives from fatal menace. Many different diagnostics and classifications have been conducted recently by using neural network as their classifier, both in simulation and real hardware implementation. Nevertheless, the products as an arrhythmia classifier are not small enough for daily use. Our previous research [3] succeeded making a simulation for heart beats classifier on neural network. In this research, we tried to implement it on a prototype small arrhythmia classifier on FPGA using Spartan 3AN development board. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A series of experiments has been conducted to show that efficiency improvement in Galois Field (GF) operators does not directly correspond to the system performance at application level. The experiments were motivated by so many research works focusing on performance improvement of GF operators. Numerous variants of operators were formed based on various combination of operation types (multiplication, division, inverse, square), representation basis (Polynomial, Normal, Dual), and processing types (serial, parallel). Each of the variants has the most efficient form in either time (fastest) or space (smallest occupied area) when implemented in FPGA chips. In fact, GF operators are not utilized individually, rather integrated one to the others in implementing algorithms, mostly in error correction codes and cryptography applications. The experiments based on the implementation of Reed Solomon Encoder and Decoder RS(15,11) 4-bit using VHDL by means of two synthesis tools the Xilinx ISE 8.2i and the Altium ProChip Designer concludes that application performance mainly depends on the composition and distribution of the operators as well as their interaction and interconnection within the system architecture.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A new algorithm based on Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) in order to control autonomous vehicles for solving odor source localization in dynamic advection-diffusion environment have been developed. Furthermore an improvements of the MPSO for odor source localization, which follows a local gradient of the chemical concentration within a plume is investigated. Another popular biomimetic approach in odor source localization problem is anemotaxis. An anemotaxis-driven agent measures the direction of the fluid's velocity and navigates "upstream" within the plume. In this paper, the combination of chemotaxis "MPSO"-based algorithm and anemotaxis will be described. This method is well known-in the animal kingdom as odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR). On the other hand, in real world, the odor distribution is multi peaks especially in obstacle environments. For that reason, a new environment with obstacle will be developed. The purpose of developing the environment is to bridge the gap between very complex, hard-to-understand real world problems (odor dispersion model) and overly simplistic-toy-problem (dynamic bit matching or moving parabola). Simulations illustrate that the new approach can solve Advection-Diffusion odor model problems in such a dynamic odor with obstacle-filled environments.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In 2015, the number of internet user in Indonesia, already reached 88.1 million. There are around 5 million SMEs in Indonesia, but only about 75 thousand are already using e-commerce which means that the adoption of e-commerce by SMEs is still relatively low. Hence, this research aims to investigate what are the supporting and inhibiting factors for sellers (SMEs) in adopting e-commerce. The initial list of factors from the literature review are validated by 11 experts which resulted 25 supporting and 17 inhibiting factors grouped by using a combination of TOE framework and UTAUT model, namely I-TOE framework. Then, we distributed questionnaires on the basis of Fuzzy-AHP to rank the factors. The results show the top supporting factors are "Perceived ease of use", "Technology infrastructure available", "Customer communication improved", and "Encouragement from environment culture" while the top inhibiting factors are "Perceived no benefit gain", "Supporting infrastructure unavailable", "Lack of business compatibility", and "Vendor less friendly to customer". © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the factors that contributes to e-commerce's success, especially in developing countries, is trust. Trust plays a significant role for e-commerce players. To build trust, we need to develop a good reputation. Hence, this research is conducted to examine (identify and prioritize) factors that can develop sellers' reputation in the online market so that sellers would be able to compete and sustain in a competitive market. This research used qualitative and quantitative approach. Seven experts were interviewed in the qualitative approach which validated and thus produced 17 factors. These factors were later categorized using the Value Chain framework. After categorizing the factors, questionnaires were created based on the Fuzzy-AHP framework and distributed to 11 sellers in the top 3 Indonesian e-marketplaces. The analysis of the questionnaires showed that the 3 highest factors that can improve sellers' reputation in Indonesia e-marketplaces are customer services, after sales services, and quality of products. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Express delivery is claimed to be a critical factor that affects e-commerce customer satisfaction and previous studies showed that customer satisfaction in turn affects customer's intention to repurchase. However, no research has discussed the relationship between express delivery service quality to repurchase intention in e-commerce. Thus, perceiving the importance of the express delivery service quality to the e-commerce industry, this research aims to examine the impact of express delivery service quality especially in B2C and C2C e-commerce. This study was conducted using a quantitative approach by distributing questionnaires to B2C or C2C e-commerce customers who ever made a purchase and had the goods shipped using express delivery services. Data of 582 respondents were collected and then analyzed using Covariance Based SEM (CB-SEM) with AMOS 22. The results showed that responsiveness and empathy dimensions of express delivery's service quality dimension give positive influence towards both customer satisfaction and trust to shop online, which will subsequently give positive influence toward repurchase intention. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In response to customer's demand enforcement, marketers need to carefully select the best marketing campaign. Marketers are creating a contest campaign that requires the participant to upload photos or videos via social media. Interdependent self-construal is one's perspective in which people are somehow connected in a social context. The technology acceptance factors, consisting performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, are also considered important to determine one's intention to use some particular technology. Hence, this study investigates how interdependent self-construal could influence one's intention to participate in social media photo/video contest campaign. Six hundred eighty-two (682) data were collected using online questionnaires and analyzed using the PLS-SEM technique. Result indicated that interdependent self-construal influences one's intention to participate in social media photo/video contest campaign through the acceptance factors of technology investigated. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Enterprise Resource Planning can provide many benefits for organizations that use them. This also holds for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). However, due to limited funds, SMEs is unable to procure a commercial ERP system. Nevertheless, even for a free ERP system, SMEs do not have the expertise in dealing with the hardware, software, nor ERP system infrastructure. Therefore, we are interested to perform analysis and design of an ERP system for SMEs that is free, able to be implemented and maintained easily by SMEs. However, in this research, we constrain ourselves to focus only on one of the main business function areas namely the Sales Area. First, we perform analysis on SMEs' business processesusing interviews to 17 SMEs in Jakarta to create generic business process model for the corresponding area. We also use additional references, i.e., analysis on two open-source ERP software packages, viz. Openbravo and Apache OF Biz. Based on the analysis, we further try to build the design of the ERP system. In the end, this research yields a generic process model of the ERP system for SMEs in the Sales Business Function Area and the corresponding Use Case Diagram (UCD), Class Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) and Architectural Deployment Diagram. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This study aims to assess the potential of memes to be used in advertising to improve the brand awareness of an Indonesian ecommerce business, Fabelio. The method used in this study is experimental-quantitative. The experiment was conducted using Instagram posts. To answer the research question, this study measured the memes virality and the brand awareness of the respondent. There are two respondent groups involved in this experiment which are respondents who follow Fabelio's Instagram account (control group) and respondents who like the memes but do not follow Fabelio's Instagram post (experimental group). The brand awareness level for both groups were compared using t-Test. The result of this study shows that the brand awareness level of the experimental group is similar with the control group which shows that memes is as effective as traditional ads in improving the brand awareness. In addition, the type of meme that has the highest virality level is silliness and sarcasm type. This finding could be used as consideration for business to implement memes as form of ads. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Primary Health Care (PHC) serves not only the primary care service but also the community health service. With such complexity, it is necessary to ensure the quality of health care equally on both sides by implementing Health Information Technology to engage both activities. The purpose of this study is to elaborate functional requirements for the Primary Health Care (PHC) business process. Thus, it may offer a foundation for the government for standardising a PHC Information System and also provide a complete structure of Health Information System (HIS) requirements for the PHC basic process: individual care business process and community health care process. This research is a qualitative study by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews and observations in two public PHC, the District Health Office of Kota Tangerang Selatan, Provincial Health Office of Banten Province, and the Indonesian Ministry of Health. The discussions were transcribed and analysed using the framework matrix analysis method. The result of this research is the functional requirements of an integrated HIS for primary care in Indonesia. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Social media became a popular platform to share information. However, since the information is shared by individual, it is important to identify which information is credible to avoid misinformation. This study aims to identify factors influencing information credibility from information consumer's perspective. There are five types of information studied which are personal, sensational, political, casual, and experience information. The study examined information from five categories of social media which are social networking sites, microblogging sites, wikis, online blogs, and online forums. Data from 255 respondents were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The results showed that link-to-other-sources is the most influential credibility factors for personal, sensational, and political information. Meanwhile, interests-in-the topic became the most important credibility factor for casual and experience information. The least favored factors for all type of information is embedded audio factor. In addition, these studies also found more additional credibility factors that have not been covered by previous study which are embedded photo/picture, source of information, writing aspects, logical, comment, similarity/coherence with other media, and similar experience. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The increasing use of internet and mobile devices has also facilitated tourists to select various tourism destinations. This study analyzes the factors that influence consumer purchase intention toward online travel packages available on e-marketplace websites. Data collection was conducted via a survey with 441 respondents who were members of online travel communities/forums; the results were processed using a AMOS v22. The results of this research indicated the factors that most influence purchase intention toward online travel packages are online word of mouth (WOM) as well as determinants of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) such as subjective norm, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. In addition, online WOM affects attitude, destination trust, subjective norm, perceived risk, perceived relative advantage, and perceived behavioral control. It was also found that perceived relative advantage affects attitude. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Knowledge is a strategic asset for an organization. Subsequently, effective knowledge management (KM) can improve organization performance. Therefore in implementing KM, the organization must know the role of KM infrastructures in supporting organizational KM processes. This research is aimed to assess the role of KM infrastructures that being implemented by the organization in supporting organizational KM processes. The research model used in this research is a modification between the research model from Allameh, Zare, and Davoodi in year 2011 and the model of KM infrastructures and KM processes from Becerra-Fernandez and Sabherwal in year 2010. This model is used as it covers all KM infrastructures and KM processes that have been researched before. Partial least squares approach is used to analyze data from 58 respondents of a telecommunication company in Indonesia. The data was collected by distributing online and hardcopy questionnaires to the employees of the company. The finding from this study is that more than 80% KM processes are influenced by KM infrastructures so it can be concluded that KM infrastructures provide a significant influence on organizational KM processes. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electronic voting (e-voting) brings the idea of modernising elections through electronic systems and provides many advantages such as efficiency, presenting results more quickly, and reducing cost. In early 21st century some countries such as India, Brazil, and Estonia have conducted research and implemented e-voting system. Meanwhile, the possibility of using e-voting for Pemilihan Umum (Indonesian General Election) is still under debate. Until 2010 the Indonesian Ministry of Home Affairs and Komisi Pemilihan Umum (The General Election Commision) refused the e-voting system which was offered by Badan Pengkajian dan Pengembangan Teknologi/BPPT (The Indonesian Agency for The Assessment and Application of Technology). Surprisingly, since 2009 Jembrana Regency, Bali Province, Indonesia has developed an e-voting system from a cafeteria order system. This system has been implemented for hamlets and villages' chief elections. The e-voting project which was held by The Local Government of Jembrana Regency and supported by BPPT is recorded as the first e-voting-based election in Indonesia. It has now become the approved-procedure of hamlet and villages' chief election. Technology-Indonesia News Portal reported that the e-voting project has been successful because people in Jembrana feel satisfied with its results and efficiency. The Public Relations Chief of Jembrana reported that e-voting saved 60% of the election budget, compared to the paper-based system. Another achievement reported by Bali Post was that no protest or conflict occured during e-voting-based elections. This demonstrates that well-developed e-voting systems can improve the democratic process, compared to Indonesian paper-based elections that sometimes cause conflicts and manipulated results. Many people are surprised that such a small regency could be so innovative. This paper focuses on how the Jembrana Regency implemented e-voting and identifies its critical success factors. The identification process was conducted by interviewing project teams and researching literature. An understanding of critical success factors of this e-voting project can provide useful information for the government and also help other regents/districts/provinces to build e-voting implementation strategies. Hopefully in the future, e-voting will be accepted as the official election procedure and bring high quality elections to the country.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Business processes (BPs) are among the most valuable assets of an organization. Knowledge management and best practices can be supported by a repository for the management, sharing and retrieval of business processes in a company or among collaborating organizations. To be effective the repository needs to provide an efficient, expressive and user-friendly query mechanism. This demo paper illustrates a BP retrieval system that leverages ORYX BP editor, with XQuery capabilities. A BP a graphical query may be expressed in using BPMN, and posed against a XPDL repository of BPs in using XQuery. Copyright © 2010 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of indicators used to measure the work performance in the office of research, development and training (Balitbangdiklat) in the Ministry of Religious Affairs in Indonesia is the utilization of research results as the policy-making basis by a technical working-unit in the ministry. In fact, until the late 2014 the utilization of research results had not met the target. The non-existence of knowledge sharing system for researchers is predicted to be one of the factors that cause the low quality of the research which in turn leads to the under-using of the research results. This study aims to analyze the knowledge management system model and design its prototype. This study uses soft system methodology approach combined with supporting theories such as Burnett's knowledge audit and the theory of culture organization by Cameron and Quinn. This research resulted in 11 activities in the conceptual model, six functional features and a non-technical mechanism design for the organization in implementing the knowledge management system. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The growing awareness of the importance of sustainability motivates companies to engage in sustainability practices. However, practising sustainability is challenging since most initiatives are interorganisational in nature. The implementation depends heavily on the capability of multiple organisations within the supply chain, which are not easily assessed. Although a few scholars have proposed a number of frameworks to help organisations identify the required organisational capabilities, none of them is comprehensive enough due to the limited scope. In order to develop a more comprehensive sustainability framework, a complete understanding of organisational capabilities needed for sustainability practices is necessary. This research-in-progress paper therefore aims to synthesize the required key capabilities based on widely implemented sustainability guidelines/standards. The identification of key capabilities is important to understand and explore how ICT can be used by organisations to develop the required sustainability capabilities. This study will potentially contribute to the development of a holistic sustainability framework.</dc:abstract>

A national report published in Olympiad in Informatics, 2010, Vol. 4 has covered the experience between 1995 and 2010. As a follow on, this article describes significant progress in the Indonesian Olympiad in Informatics (abbreviated as OKI in Indonesian) since 2010. The progress was driven by clearer structure of stakeholders and processes, updates on national curriculum, the establishment of national contest management system and more active alumni involvement which supports a more stable performance for OKI team (abbreviated as TOKI in Indonesian) in IOI. We analyze briefly each progression which might be relevant to other countries facing similar challenges. © 2014 Vilnius University, IOI.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Block-sorting is an innovative compression mechanism introduced in 1994 by Burrows and Wheeler. It involves three steps: permuting the input one block at a time through the use of the Burrows-Wheeler transform (bwt); applying a move-to-front (mtf) transform to each of the permuted blocks; and then entropy coding the output with a Huffman or arithmetic coder. Until now, block-sorting implementations have assumed that the input message is a sequence of characters. In this paper we extend the block-sorting mechanism to word-based models. We also consider other recency transformations, and are able to show improved compression results compared to mtf and uniform arithmetic coding. For large files of text, the combination of word-based modeling, bwt, and mtf-like transformations allows excellent compression effectiveness to be attained within reasonable resource costs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	<dc:abstract>Parsing is introduced as a fourth transformation to the block-sorting (BWT) compression. It is shown that in some situations, the introduction of a simple parsing stage allows improved compression to be obtained compared to an otherwise equivalent character-based BWT implementation. An MTF-like ranking transformation that caters better to large-alphabet situations than does the strict MTF rule used in conventional BWT implementations is also described.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>SMS spam has been growing since mobile phone usage increases. Past researches on SMS spam detection only classified SMS into two categories, spam and not spam. The binary classification of SMS spam prevents the user from seeing the spam messages that they do not really hate, e.g. an advertisement from their favorite product In this paper, we propose multi-class classification of SMS into: regular, info, ads, and fraud. We use content-based (top-N unigram) as well as non-content based features. The result shows that the best accuracy is achieved by logistic regression that is 97.5 % accuracy with configuration of normalization preprocess and 4096 top-N unigram features. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Now the knowledge source in natural language text are available in large quantities. There is an increasing need of knowledge representation, then it would require the knowledge processing on text automatically. The previous research has built on knowledge representation system of natural language text that is OWLizr. However, this study has not been able to handle the knowledge representation in concepts that describe a particular object. This paper developed a knowledge representation system in copula sentences containing concepts in Bahasa Indonesia. If the concept can be handled then the relationship between concepts with components of existing ontology can defined. This supports ontology engineering process that build domain ontology by enrich knowledge of the existing knowledge base. This system combine NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to model the knowledge contained in the copula sentence. The testing in this system is by unit testing and testing on collection of sentences which adapted from Wikipedia. The results of this research are system can represent knowledge in copula sentences containing concepts in Bahasa Indonesia. The system can generate output in OWL knowledge base that can share and reuse for other systems. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>We adopt a previously developed model of deep syntactic and semantic processing to support question answering for Bahasa Indonesia, and extend it by adding a number of axioms designed to encode useful knowledge for answering questions, thus increasing the inferential power of the QA system. We believe this approach can increase the robustness of semantic analysis-based QA systems, whilst simultaneously lightening the burden of complexity in designing semantic attachment rules that transduce logical forms from syntactic structures. We show how these added axioms enable the system to answer questions which previously could not have been answered. © 2008 by Rahmad Mahendra, Septina Dian Larasati, and Ruli Manurung.</dc:abstract>

This research was conducted to identify problem and give recommendation of factors influencing implementation success ERP to avoid recurrence of the same problem in the next project. In preparing for implementation an ERP in an organization, there are several things to note that are critical success factor in implementing an ERP. There is a research from Deloitte which was in 2005, shows that factors from change management are very influential on successful implementation in ERP, which the highest factor are project leadership (87%), deployment (83%), end-user training (70%), end-user communication (53%), end user involvement (50%), and just around 20% which show that cultural factor affect the success of implementation. The existence of this research is expected to help institution in preventing failures in ERP project implementation in the future. © 2019 IEEE. All Rights Reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Mobile application providing access to some Online Social Network (OSN) services like Facebook and Twitter had been launch bundled with a data access subscription plan. At the end of 2010, the user of the application increased significantly to more than two millions subscribers while the number of active users grew slowly for only about 300.000 users per month. This research was conducted to see how the user use the OSN application. This research utilized the data collected from user's profile, transaction log and activity log from the service provider. The result was then analyzed using descriptive statistics to discover the pattern of user's behavior of the mobile online social network application. Authors found that user's behavior of mobile online social network service was almost the same as other online social network service users but with special characteristics since mobile users tend to have close session-tosession interval and might have longer session duration. This study will give the service provider recommendation to define better strategy for future development and improvement. The result can also be a reference for another similar research on mobile online social network application in the future. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Monitoring system is a crucial part in establishing sophisticated IT infrastructure. Monitoring of IT infrastructure becomes indispensable for knowing the status and performance of technology components. Complex infrastructure, such as virtualization and cloud computing systems, boost up the number of nodes to be monitored. Notifications accumulate, which makes it more difficult to track problems. With lots of unneccessary notifications, the challenge to provide availability and improve service quality becomes more complex. A monitoring system that can deliver accurate monitoring information is needed. This research proposed a method to manage IT infrastructure monitoring system using Lean method. Lean method is a popular method of process management and has been successfully used in several IT process improvement projects. The results of this research show that lean methods can be applied to increase the quality of monitoring system, through the process stages that have been described in the lean implementation principle. Quantitatively it is known that after the lean method is applied, the number of network elements, nodes and interfaces monitored increases by 39%, 105% and 1%, respectively. While the alerts and events generated decreased by 77% and 49%, respectively. Qualitatively based on the identification of value achievement, the system can deliver the value expected by the customer, in which case the customer is a user of monitoring system. © 2019 IEEE.

	<dc:abstract>Big Data is a condition in which data size in a database is very large so it is difficult to be managed. An e-Learning application, like SCeLE Fasilkom UI (scele.cs.ui.ac.id), also has a very large data. SCeLE has hundreds of forum data, and each forum has at least 4000 threads of discussion. In addition, one thread can have at least dozens or hundreds posts. Therefore, it may further experience data growth problem, which will be difficult to be handled by RDBMS, such as MySQL that is currently used. In order to solve this problem, a research been conducted to apply Big Data in SCeLE Fasilkom UI, which implementation is aimed to increase SCeLE's data management performance. The implementation of Big Data in the research used MongoDB as the system's DBMS. The research result showed that MongoDB obtain better results than MySQL in SCeLE Fasilkom UI forum data case in terms of speed. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents an idea in the context of multicasting: it is to manage QoS with a certain level of hazard. The Xcast and IPv6 are used in the context of IPTV which is a contestable choice since the number of user could be high regarding the size of the packet header. In large IPTV network, even an IPTV stream with a small number of subscribers could have hundreds of them. Moreover if Xcast stream is used for session with a very small number of users, it is necessary to consider concurrence multicast flow using normal multicast routing scheme. Simulation results using NS3 shows that the proposed QoS mechanism has a good performance in term of throughput. © 2010 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Automatic text summarization is generally considered as a challenging task in the NLP community. One of the challenges is the publicly available and large dataset that is relatively rare and difficult to construct. The problem is even worse for low-resource languages such as Indonesian. In this paper, we present INDOSUM, a new benchmark dataset for Indonesian text summarization. The dataset consists of news articles and manually constructed summaries. Notably, the dataset is almost 200x larger than the previous Indonesian summarization dataset of the same domain. We evaluated various extractive summarization approaches and obtained encouraging results which demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset and provide baselines for future research.

	<dc:abstract>Slot filling techniques are often adopted in language understanding components for task-oriented dialogue systems. In recent approaches, neural models for slot filling are trained on domain-specific datasets, making it difficult porting to similar domains when few or no training data are available. In this paper we use multi-task learning to leverage general knowledge of a task, namely Named Entity Recognition (NER), to improve slot filling performance on a semantically similar domain-specific task. Our experiments show that, for some datasets, transfer learning from NER can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art and can also help slot filling in low resource scenarios. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

	<dc:abstract>For AI systems to reason about real world situations, they need to recognize which processes are at play and which entities play key roles in them. Our goal is to extract this kind of role-based knowledge about processes, from multiple sentence-level descriptions. This knowledge is hard to acquire; while semantic role labeling (SRL) systems can extract sentence level role information about individual mentions of a process, their results are often noisy and they do not attempt create a globally consistent characterization of a process. To overcome this, we extend standard within sentence joint inference to inference across multiple sentences. This cross sentence inference promotes role assignments that are compatible across different descriptions of the same process. When formulated as an Integer Linear Program, this leads to improvements over within-sentence inference by nearly 3% in F1. The resulting role-based knowledge is of high quality (with a F1 of nearly 82). © 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A modern web document typically consists of many kinds of information. Besides the main content which conveys the primary information, a web document also contains noisy contents such as advertisements, headers, footers, decorations, copyright information, navigation menus etc. The presence of noisy contents may affect the performance of applications such as commercial search engines, web crawlers, and web miners. Therefore, extracting main contents from web document and removing noisy contents is an important process. In this paper we present an approach for extracting main content from web documents which combines classification tasks and heuristic approaches.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Usability testing is used to ensure that the application can be used by the users and according to the user needs. Basically, there are two usability testing methods: the conventional method and the remote method. In this study, we focus on the remote method (more specifically on the remote asynchronous method).The remote asynchronous method means that the tester and the evaluator of the test result are separated by time and location. Within this method, we compared the use of forum and diary. We analyzed the used of these two methods in remote asynchronous method. The goals of this study are to find out which of these two are more efficient in identifying the usability problems, and the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods. The result of our study shows that the diary enables us to identify more usability problems. Our further analysis shows the reason for this is due to the constant daily exposure to the application during the whole testing process. This also allows the tester to become more familiar with application which leads to a faster time in finishing the test than the forum method.Nevertheless, the number of respondents who were able to finish completely the test scenario using the diary method is less than the forum method. We probed this matter further and found that the reasons are they can be persistence in working on the test every day and/or they just completely forgot to do the test on certain days. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Customer satisfaction of a service or product is reflected in the customer's attitude towards the service or product once the customer perceived or used the service or product. Customer satisfaction has many dimensions, and previous studies have identified and used those many dimensions to measure the customer satisfaction of a certain service or product. In this study, we explore the use of text mining techniques of modeling topic as a way of discovering customer satisfaction dimensions, and we used tweets data from Twitter as our dataset. These are our contributions. We believed that this approach had not been used for discovering customer satisfaction dimensions. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for the topic modeling, and perplexity model and topic coherence are used for optimizing the number of topics. We would then choose representative words for each topic formed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The name of the topic is added by analyzing the logical relationships between the representative words and find the semantic meaning of the representative words in the context of the original tweets. These are done manually by the authors. Once the labels have been identified, we associate the labels to the original tweets. The identified topics in our study become customer satisfaction dimensions. The last task in our study is comparing the identified dimensions with dimensions in previous studies. In this task, we needed to broaden the definition of dimensions from previous studies. The result shows our identified dimensions are fitted with the dimensions from previous studies. The main differences are the naming of the dimensions and the granularity of the dimensions. Our identified dimensions have finer granularity than previous studies. Our study enables the decision maker to be informed with the current dimensions, which are mattered by the customer in using the organization's services or products. Once the tweets are labeled to the identified topic names, we can sort the topics having the most documents.

	<dc:abstract>This paper describes the application of a community detection algorithm, namely LinkRank algorithm, on a citation network. Community detection is a task in network analysis which aims to find sets of tightly connected nodes that are loosely connected with other nodes outside of those sets. In our study, we focused on a citation network which depicts relationships between cited papers and the papers which cite those papers. The objectives of our study are to identify communities of papers based on the citation relationships and analyze the similarities of topics within each community. The approach of our study to reach the objectives is by applying LinkRank algorithm to a citation network. LinkRank algorithm is chosen because it can be applied to a directed network where other algorithms that we have surveyed can only be used on undirected network. The citation network that we used in our study is from Aminer website. In applying the algorithm, we had to port the original source code which is written in C programming language into Python programming language for our convenience in doing the experiment. The result shows that the algorithm able to detect 10,442 communities from 188,514 nodes. Once the communities have been detected, we sampled top three communities (the ones with the largest number of members) and took the top 10 nodes with the highest PageRank score in each of those communities. The samples show that most of the nodes have similar topic, but there are still some nodes with different topics mixed inside the same community. We found the ratio between nodes with similar and different topics to be 7 to 3, that is 70% of the nodes have similar topic while the other 30% have different topics. Thus, the homophily of each community does not reach 100%. Nevertheless, our study confirms that LinkRank algorithm can be used for community detection on directed network. © 2018 The Authors.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Internet topology research at the AS-level is generally carried out globally, while lesser research focuses on certain regional topologies. The motivation of this research is to provide a portrait of Indonesia’s Internet topology at the AS-level over the past ten years, from 2009 to 2018; with datasets taken from APNIC and CAIDA. Analysis of ten years consecutive data shows that the number of ASNs allocated for Indonesia has increased by around 114 new ASNs per year, while the average network diameter and path length has been quite constant over the past ten years. The growth in the number of AS nodes and links occurs linearly with a ratio of nodes: links around 1:2.5. Indonesia’s Internet topology at the AS-level has scale-free property, with the presence of hubs in the topology; this results in a robust topology against random attacks with a critical threshold above 90% but still susceptible to targeted attacks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Web applications are one of the targets in information security attacks. Many security holes can be exploited can be source of damage and operational disruption of the application itself and even the IT infrastructure in i t Web Application Security Issues usually relate to problems that the developer or the owner may not aware or tend to ignore the issues. The main objective is to enumerate, describe and analyze security issues of the government official web application in Indonesia. The issues covers technical, environment and support issues of application development configuration and security governance. Technical and environment issues identified using application vulnerability scanners tools. The result shows that web applications have most weakness in configuration issues, both application and security configuration. All of weaknesses that identified relate to technical development application environment and support. The state of the art of the work lay on that how to improve the quality of web application development which often ignore security requirement during design, development and deployment. That conditions may raise security issue when the web application has published that may affect other systems. The work recommend several approach to handle the security issues as a contribution to developer and the owner to fix the issues. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the important steps in steganography is to figure out how to embed a certain amount of message into cover medium (usually image). Different images may have different capacity and on top of that compression must also be considered. Embedding capacity is highly influenced by image complexity which reflects on quantized DCT histogram. For a lay person, the crucial factor is to know what kind of image is better suited for the amount of message to be hidden. Hence, the research aims at finding a relationship between image genre and steganographic capacity. The result shows that more objects in the image means more message to be hidden. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Deep neural network based models has showed excellent ability in solving complex learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Deep neural network learns data representations by solving specific learning task from the input data. Several optimization algorithms such as SGD, Momentum, Nesterov, RMSProp, and Adam were commonly used to minimize the loss function of deep neural networks model. At some point, the model may leak some information about the training data. To mitigate this leakage, differentially private optimization algorithm can be used to train the neural network model. In this paper, differentially private Momentum, Nesterov, RMSProp, and Adam algorithms were developed and used to train deep neural networks models like DNN and CNN. It was shown that those differentially private optimization algorithms can perform better than differentially private SGD, yielding higher model accuracy and faster convergence. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a set of electronic sensor nodes that are used to measure various environmental parameters such as air temperature, humidity, light, physical movement, and others. WSN takes measurements from multiple points that are spread widely and continuously over a period of time. The WSN protocol is designed to have very low power consumption. The most popular example of the WSN protocol is Zigbee, which is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. WSN uses a multi-hop communication system in which each node can act as a router and can be directly involved in the routing process. This characteristic makes WSN very vulnerable to security threats especially threats on the network layer. Sinkhole attack is an active routing attack on a very dangerous network layer because it modifies packet contents, modifies, re-send and fake the contents of packet [1]. There are several methods of detection and mitigation for sinkhole attacks, there are Delphi method and Multipath routing protocol AODV. But there has been no detailed discussion of the security strategy for both methods. This study discusses the security strategy to achieve a balance between security and usability in WSN applications for both methods. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Big Data is a new concept that has become widely popularised in recent years. The revolutionized meaning of information communication technologies and Internet technologies refers to mobile communications which enable individuals to move and generate, transmit and receive different kinds of information. There are many communication options where users can search, interact and share information with other users such as website, social media, online communities blogs, and email called as Digital transformation. In Digital transformation era, over 95 % of travellers today use digital resources. Digital traveler can be as data source for official statistics. One of methods to capture the number of tourist can use Mobile Positioning Data (MPD). This method is considered able to improve the quality of survey data. This article will discuss further how to improve the quality of survey data through Big Data with case studies of MPD users in Indonesian Tourism Statistics. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Research in the smart campus area is still growing, where every researcher defines the concept of smart campus with a less thorough perspective that has not been conical in the same conception of the concept. In this paper, we summarize the existing condition of smart campus development in term of features, supported technologies, and applications were built using systematic literature review (SLR) as the standard methodology used to solve any problems by tracing the results of previous research. The problems declared in SLR are commonly called as research question (RQ). To achieve that goal, we define some RQs related to that scope and clarify each question by tracing previous research papers which are indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Springerlink, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 29 articles, the results are: Contactless technology provides an easier way to enter data when accessing a particular room or equipment than using a keyboard; IoT supports an easier way to report real-time environment status; cloud computing is used to organize various information effectively and provide data services; iCampus becomes a popular smart campus model and if we map the applications that have been built into iCampus; there is no applications as part of iHealth domain. The main contribution of smart campus development based on previous research is to make easier in all campus aspect life. The contribution expected through this paper is to provide an overview for researchers who want to build applications in a campus as research challenge so that they can use appropriate technology and meet the characteristics of smart campus. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research was motivated by the expanding scope of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementation held by Indonesia State Cryptography Agency (Lembaga Sandi Negara - Lemsaneg). Previously it was only within the scope of the Government Electronic Procurement Service, and now it must be expanded to meet the needs of government agencies services in general. With the expanding scope of the PKI, the Certificate Policy must also be reevaluated and a new policy is formulated. In this study, the new Certificate Policy (CP) is formulated using Soft Systems Methodology process. The proposed Certificate Policy is based on Levels of Assurance (LoA) to accommodate the need of different government bodies. The certificate profile analysis follows the Certificate Policy Framework of IETF RFC 3647. NIST Internal Report 7924 has been selected as the template for the Certificate Policy document due to its closeness to PKI implementation requirements in Lemsaneg and the latest information system security demands. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) is employed to learn important genes (biomarkers) on gene expression data from human carcinoma colorectal. The learning process involves gene expression data and several patient phenotypes such as lymph node and distant metastasis occurrence. The proposed framework in this paper uses multimodal DBM to train records with metastasis occurrence. Later, the trained model is tested using records with no metastasis occurrence. After that, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is measured from the reconstructed and the original gene expression data. Genes are ranked based on the MSE value. The first gene has the highest MSE value. After that, k-means clustering is performed using various number of genes. Features that give the highest purity index are considered as the important genes. The important genes obtained from the proposed framework and two sample t-test are being compared. From the accuracy of metastasis classification, the proposed framework gives higher results compared to the top genes from two sample t-test. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

This makes the target cannot serve the real request service. Thus we need to develop DDoS detector system. The proposed system consists of traffic capture, packet analyzer, and packet displayer. The system utilizes Ntopng as main traffic analyzer. Detector system has to meet good standard in accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability. We evaluate the system using one of dangerous DDoS tool named Slowloris. The system can detect attacks and provide alerts to detector user. The system also can process all incoming packets with a small margin of error (0.76%). © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, a framework using deep learning approach is proposed to identify two subtypes of human colorectal carcinoma cancer. The identification process uses information from gene expression and clinical data which is obtained from data integration process. One of deep learning architecture, multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) is used for data integration process. The joint representation gene expression and clinical is later used as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) input for cancer subtype identification. Kaplan Meier survival analysis is employed to evaluate the identification result. The curves on survival plot obtained from Kaplan Meier analysis are tested using three statistic tests to ensure that there is a significant difference between those curves. According to Log Rank, Generalized Wilcoxon and Tarone-Ware, the two groups of patients with different cancer subtypes identified using the proposed framework are significantly different. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Learning hidden information or pattern on gene expression data to uncover an underlying molecular features is called gene expression profiling. To perform gene expression profiling, an unsupervised machine learning method can be employed. In this paper, Gaussian RBM is proposed to obtain the optimal number of clusters and their members on human colorectal cancer dataset provided by Muro. Gaussian RBM forms two large numbers of genes clusters and one smaller cluster which has several tumour-classifier genes as its members. The two large numbers of genes clusters formed by Gaussian RBM succeed in showing a significant correlation with the existence of tumour and distant metastasis but they show no significant correlation with lymph node metastasis existence. The smaller number of genes clusters gives a statistically significant result in clustering patients into two groups. © 2017 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This work is an initial study of the research that aims to help people by giving an information about the earthquake while it happens eventhough the phone is not connected to the internet. In this research, we identify the pattern of the simulated earthquake signal from the mobile phone accelerometer via machine learning. Before the data is processed into the classifier, static windowing and denoising was done to boost up the accuracy. Another fractal features are extracted from the pre-denoised data, which are the box counting dimension feature and the Hurst coefficient. The purpose of doing static windowing is to obtain more features so that we can have many potential useful attribute candidates as possible. Denoising with symlet wavelet is done to remove the noises which can worsen the classification accuracy. The classification is done using support vector machine and multilayer perceptron classifier with the accuracy of 81% and 82.15%, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS Attack) is one of the types of attacks that use multiple hosts as attacker against a system. There is a difference between Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS Attack) and Denial-of-Service (DoS Attack). DDoS attacks are distributed, meaning spread using multiple hosts, while the DoS attack is one-on-one. DoS attacks requires a powerful host, either from the resource or operating system used to carry out the attack. In this study, we discuss how to handle DDoS attacks in the form of detection method based on the pattern of flow entries and handling mechanism using layered firewall. Tests carried out using three scenario that is simulations on normal network environment, unsecured network, and secure network. Then, we analyze the simulations result that has been done. The method used successfully filtering incoming packet, by dropped packets from the attacker when DDoS attack happen, while still be able to receive packets from legitimate hosts. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Traditional network level firewalls, based on port and IP addresses, are inadequate for dealing with the development of applications and protocols that do not follow the conventions of port services established by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). Therefore firewalls capable of accurately classifying and filtering connections based on application information are needed. This paper studies one such firewall using Netfilter/Iptables with the L7-filter packet classifier to perform application layer filtering. This packet classifier uses regular expressions to match applications with a protocol definition database. We analyze a video streaming protocol, the Adobe Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), to produce a protocol definition. Analysis of the performance of the protocol definition and L7-filter usage in general in a simulated network environment shows that this implementation functions well and does not disrupt network performance. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Signature verification is the process used to recognize an individual's handwritten signature. Signature verification can be divided into two main areas depending on the data acquisition method, off-line and on-line signature verification. In this paper we attempt to survey the signature verification based on three categories. First, judging from how to get the data signature which is off-line and on-line verification. Second, based on the technique used, that is rule-based approach, neural networks, hidden markov model and support vector machine. Third, based on preprocessing and feature extraction, which is thinning and line segmentation. Based on the survey, it was concluded that any method of verification has advantages and disadvantages. However, if viewed from the ease of implementation and performance, using neural networks or hidden markov models are the right choice. Depending on the data acquisition method, on-line verification is recommended to use than off-line verification. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An analytical study of Fast Reservation Protocol is presented as a way to compare FRP performance against simple statistical multiplexing. The comparison is done on the basis of the multiplexing capability of each scheme. Queueing models for both schemes are developed and based on these models the maximum numbers of sources that can be multiplexed by each scheme is then computed. The results quantitatively confirm the previously accepted characteristics of FRP, i.e. that it is good for long burst and short round trip delay.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Non-extraction orthodontic treatment in borderline cases is reported, according to some authors, to lead to upper and lower incisor inclination changes affecting patients' soft tissue profiles. Here, we aim to determine the correlation, in non-extraction Class I malocclusion cases, between the upper and lower incisor inclination changes toward the nasolabial angle and the mentolabial angle before and after orthodontic treatment. (We took before and after lateral cephalometric radiographs on 26 patients with non-extraction Class I malocclusion orthodontic treatment.) We measured the I-SN, IMP, nasolabial, and mentolabial angles. For statistical analysis, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon test and the Spearmen correlation test. There was no significant difference between the I-SN and nasolabial angles, but a significant difference between the IMP and mentolabial angles, before and after treatment. The correlation test showed very weak negative and positive correlations between the change in the I-SN angle and the change in the nasolabial angle, and the change in the IMP angle and the change in the mentolabial angle, respectively. The decrease in the I-SN angle was followed by an increase in the nasolabial angle, even though the correlation was very weak. The increase in the IMP angle was followed by an increase in the mentolabial angle, which was also very weakly correlated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Grid Systems is a formalism for modelling population and ecosystem dynamics that combines features of membrane computing, such as rewrite rules and maximal parallelism, with a representation of space similar to that of Cellular Automata. Moreover, Grid Systems include features for the description of environmental events and of events that can be associated with frequencies and durations that can be either deterministic or stochastic. The combination of all of these features makes Grid Systems a comprehensive formalism for the modelling and analysis of ecosystems. This tool paper describes the implementation and the features of a simulator for Grid Systems. The simulator is equipped with a graphical user interface for defining and editing models of populations, and for simulating population dynamics and movement. The aim of this tool is to allow modellers to construct and analyse models based on a comprehensive and rigorous formalism such as Grid Systems with a friendly interface. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Seasonal migration is the long-distance movement of a large number of animals belonging to one or more species that occurs on a seasonal basis. It is an important phenomenon that often has a major impact on one or more ecosystem(s). It is not fully understood how this population dynamics phenomenon emerges from the behaviours and interactions of a large number of animals. We propose an approach to the modelling of seasonal migration in which dynamics is stochastically modelled using rewriting systems, and spatiality is approximated by a grid of cells. We apply our approach to the migration of a wildebeest species in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Our model relies on the observations that wildebeest migration is driven by the search for grazing areas and water resources, and animals tend to follow movements of other animals. Moreover, we assume the existence of dynamic guiding paths. These paths could either be representations of the individual or communal memory of wildebeests, or physical tracks marking the land. Movement is modelled by rewritings between adjacent cells, driven by the conditions in the origin and destination cells. As conditions we consider number of animals, grass availability, and dynamic paths. Paths are initialised with the patterns of movements observed in reality, but dynamically change depending on variation of movement caused by other conditions. This methodology has been implemented in a simulator that visualises grass availability as well as population movement. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>A new formalism, Grid Systems, aimed at modelling population dynamics is presented. The formalism is inspired by concepts of Membrane Computing (P Systems) and spatiality dynamics of Cellular Automata. The semantics of Grid Systems describes how stochasticity is exploited for reaction duration as well as reaction selection. Grid Systems perform reactions in maximally parallel manner, imitating natural processes. Environmental events that change population behaviour can be defined in Grid Systems as rewrite rules. A population model of a species of mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus, is presented. The model considers three types of external events: temperature change, rainfall, and desiccation. The events change the behaviour of the species directly or indirectly. Each individual in the population can move around in the ecosystem. The simulation of the model was performed by using a semantics based tool. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a framework of deep learning in generative models. The generative model aims to synthesize a new data so that it has a distribution of distribution according to the original data distribution. In the current development, GAN is not only used to synthesize data from noise alone, but in the current development it has begun to be used to translate data from a domain to data with a different domain. Several studies have been developed, such as CycleGAN, and Pix2pix. In this study, the face has not been used as an object of translation. In this study a model for translating images of face sketches into face images will be made. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

Recent research on generative learning have produced powerful image-toimage translation methods in supervised setting, where paired training datasets are available. However, collecting paired training data is difficult, expensive and required manual authoring. We present an evaluation study of recent unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models that can learn to translate a facial image from a source domain X to a target domain Y without paired labeled training dataset. Each GAN model is trained on the same facial image dataset and comparable hyperparameters.

	<dc:abstract>Facial expression recognition is an active research challenge in computer vision and artificial intelligence since facial expressions contribute non-verbal information in human communication. Capturing facial features become an important phase in facial recognition systems. Finding suitable feature descriptor is essential to determine the recognition results. We propose a novel geometric feature extraction method which apply simple calculation techniques for facial components to ensure the robustness for each variation of pose. Unlike any other features which require more efforts in a transformation process, the proposed method efficiently works directly on pixels basis. We apply our proposed features into a facial expression recognition system and validate emotion results on extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) emotion dataset and gives accuracy rate 93.67%. © 2019 IEEE.

	<dc:abstract>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is one of machine learning's methods which within past decades, the development of RBMs has quite increase. Researches of RBMs focused on theories and applications of RBMs. The application of RBMs has proofed that RBMs good at finishing many tasks, such as feature extraction method, document modeling, representation learning, classification and others. The RBMs' theories also have great movements, such as the development of the learning algorithm and inference techniques of RBMs. The key factors making the RBM success on finishing task are the learning algorithm and inference techniques. They motivated the development of inference techniques which successfully improved the deep neural network (DNN) performance. The aim of this research is reviewing the various types of RBMs as the application side, and the development of learning algorithm and inference techniques as theoretical side. Hopefully, it could motivate more development on the RBMs in order to contribute on overcoming implementation tasks especially on image processing tasks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Capturing non-verbal information from a face is the most important phase in emotion recognition through facial expression. In order to do that, it needs to find suitable features extraction method that could help to figure out the meaning from the given face. Inspired by Liliana Dewi[1] that used a geometric feature for analyzing facial component with a good result accuracy around 98.59%. So this paper tries to improve that method in order to enhance the result of facial components analysis. This study use Hellen dataset to retrain the Active Appearance Model (AAM), add image preprocessing like image enhancement, use other geometric features and Fuzzy Rule-Based System for extract the feature on extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) dataset. The result of this research gives better in recognizing facial components than previous work with accuracy around 99.36%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, the social intelligent machine is developed to be more human-like by understanding human emotion. Therefore, many researches attempt to capture nonverbal signals which visually appears on facial expressions to recognize human emotions. Face is being explored because face mostly reveals the emotion contains in it. Many researches on facial expression recognition have been done and delivered optimistic results, however continuous research must be afforded to increase the performance of some methods. This paper is written as a part of doctoral research study on human emotion recognition as an effort to depict and elaborate the roadmap of research on automatic emotion recognition. In this paper, firstly we describe about Social Signal Processing as the emotion recognition domain. Secondly, the analysis of a human emotion model. Thirdly, the method of Facial Expression Recognition (FER), followed by the description about state of the art research on FER. Lastly, we explore about the prospect of the next research on FER as a part of the development on this field. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

Moreover, from psychological perspective humans express multiple emotions simultaneously. Up to now, researchers recognize two basic emotions at the same time, called mixed emotions. Nevertheless, the mixed emotion still does not reflect how humans express the emotion naturally. This paper advances the concept of mixed emotion into a generalized fuzzy emotion. Fuzzy emotion captures multiple emotions in a single image using fuzzy inference engine. We propose a fuzzy emotion framework which consists of processing system and knowledge system. The processing system extracts facial expression parameters, and the knowledge system employs a fuzzy knowledge-based engine, elicited from the psychologist knowledge to recognize facial expressions. Some advantages are offered: (1) no facial template comparison; (2) no training efforts needed; (3) moreover, fuzzy emotion can recognize ambiguous facial expressions adaptively. The experiment gives a recognition result with the highest accuracy rate of 0.90. A research agenda for future study of mixed emotion recognition is proposed. © 2019, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In Social Signal Processing (SSP) and affective computing area, the publicly available facial expression dataset for emotion recognition task is still limited for basic emotion categories. Whereas in everyday life, various types of emotions are being used by humans more than basic emotion, such as mixed emotion. To enrich the diversity of the existing dataset, we developed the Indonesian Mixed Emotion Dataset (IMED). The objective of creating this dataset is to provide the annotated data for mixed emotion recognition as a ground-truth for benchmarking. Mixed emotion is constructed by combining basic emotion categories to resulting new ones. This dataset can be used to facilitate mixed emotion recognition experiments. Our dataset displays 19 categories of emotions performed by 15 subjects, all are Indonesians with various ethnicities: Javanese, Sundanese, Malay, Bataknese, Minang, and Manadonian. Subjects are 60% female and 40% male with age ranging from 17 to 32 demonstrated basic and mixed emotion classes in videos. We then used a computational model to show that mixed emotion categories were discriminable to be recognized by machine classifiers. We believe that IMED dataset is useful for researchers on the same field to test their novel method by using our dataset. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recently, emotion recognition has gained increasing attention in various applications related to Social Signal Processing (SSP) and human affect. The existing research is mainly focused on six basic emotions (happy, sad, fear, disgust, angry, and surprise). However human expresses many kind of emotions, including mix emotion which has not been explored due to its complexity. We model 12 types of mix emotion recognition from facial expression in a sequence of images using two-stages learning which combines Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as sequence classifiers. SVM classifies each image frame and produce emotion label output, subsequently it becomes the input for CRF which yields the mix emotion label of the corresponding observation sequence. We evaluate our proposed model on modified image frames of Cohn Kanade+ dataset, and on our own made mix emotion dataset. We also compare our model with the original CRF model, and our model shows a superior performance result. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Human emotion recognition is an emerging research area in the field of social signal processing. Facial expression is an important means to detect human emotion. The problem is some facial expressions represent similar emotions. Thus, the recognition must consider the ambiguity in the way human expresses emotions through face. Existing methods do not take into account the level of expression's ambiguity. In our research, we specify face points and display the degree of fuzzy cluster on eight face emotions, namely anger, contempt, disgust, happy, surprise, sadness, fear, and neutral. The proposed methods are based on Active Appearance Model (AAM) and semi-supervised Fuzzy C-means (FCM). We tested the system on Cohn Kanade+ dataset of facial expression which provided eight classes of human emotion. Our methods gain an average accuracy rate of 80.71% and surpass the existing Fuzzy Inference System. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Many texts in online media consist of various information that need an appropriate way to extract and interpret them clearly. For better understanding of the content in the text collected from any online media, a proper methodology for the interpretation of useful information must be developed. This study offers a modified process of the text interpretation consisting of four stages with a preliminary stage of the text preprocessing and key phrase extraction using the annotated suffix tree (AST) technique and secondary stage of developing sparse clustering method named as iterative scaling of fuzzy additive spectral clustering (is-FADDIS) combined with a sharpening technique for grouping key phrases from the text. An ontology as the “knowledge base” was developed combining with is-FADDIS method as the third stage. Interpretation from the input text was carried out as the final stage of the text interpretation. The performances of is-FADDIS clustering combined with sharpening technique as high as 96 and 78% were verified for some modeled sparse data and two specific real sparse data from two corpus, respectively, and could be better when comparing with Nonnegative Matrices Factorization (NMF) and K-means. The text interpretation of using the ontology gives a clear graph visualization on the relationship among key phrases even though it has a low correlation with content of the text. The result findings of this study potentially help us in ensuring an automatic process to be used for the interpretation of any topic information collected from online media. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we present a comprehensive review of a well-known sequential classifier in machine learning Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs is proposed to cope the limitation of both generative Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and discriminative Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) for solving the sequential classification problems. CRFs is widely used to accomplish the sequential classification which has a temporal dimension. On its way, CRFs has been improved both on the structural learning model as well as on the area of implementation. Those areas are varying from information extraction, image understanding, computer vision, behavioral analysis, natural language processing, bioinformatics, etc. This review provides a compact and informative summary of the major research on CRFs. We present a brief description about CRFs fundamental, CRFs roadmap, and CRFs related area of implementation from several literature papers on CRFs. The contribution of this paper is to explore the roadmap of CRFs research and potential prospect in developing CRFs to solve machine learning problems, particularly problems with sequential structures. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The existing research using various method for modeling human facial to entirely describe facial expression through face image. We consider to variation analysis of the face image using Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) method. GPA is implied for modeling variation of facial expression. We fit our GPA model exact the position of facial skeleton using Active Appearance Model (AAM). AAM is needed for extract shape feature of face image. Also, we use Gabor to get texture information of face image. The facial expression recognition method is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM).

	<dc:abstract>Emotion recognition from facial expression is the subfield of social signal processing which is applied in wide variety of areas, specifically for human and computer interaction. Many researches have been proposed for automatic emotion recognition, which is fundamentally using machine learning approach. However, recognizing basic emotions such as angry, happy, disgust, fear, sad, and surprise is still becoming a challenging problem in computer vision. Lately, deep learning has gained more attention to solve many real-world problems, including emotion recognition. In this research, we enhanced Convolutional Neural Network method to recognize 6 basic emotions and compared some preprocessing methods to show the influences of its in CNN performance. The compared data preprocessing methods are: resizing, face detection, cropping, adding noises, and data normalization consists of local normalization, global contrast normalization and histogram equalization. Face detection as single pre-processing phase achieved significant result with 86.08 % of accuracy, compared with another pre-processing phase and raw data. However, by combining those techniques can boost performance of CNN and achieved 97.06% of accuracy. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Text document is an important source of information and knowledge. Most of the knowledge needed in various domains for different purposes is in form of implicit content. A content of text is represented by keyphrases, which consists of one or more meaningful words. Keyphrases can be extracted from text through several steps of processing, including text preprocessing. Annotated Suffix Tree (AST) built from the documents collection itself is used to extract the keyphrase, after basic text preprocessing that includes removing stop words and stemming are applied. Combination of four variations of preprocessing is used. Two words (bi-words) and three-words of phrases extracted are used as a list of keyphrases candidate which can help user who needs keyphrase information to understand content of documents. The candidate of keyphrase can be processed further by learning process to determine keyphrase or non keyphrase for the text domain with manual validation. Experiments using simulation corpus in which keyphrases are determined from them show that keyphrases of two and three words can be extracted more than 90%. Using real corpus of economy, keyphrases or meaningful phrases can be extracted about 70%. The proposed method can be an effective way to find candidate keyphrases from collection of text documents which can reduce non keyphrases or non meaningful phrases from list of keyphrase candidates and can detect keyphrases separated by stopwords.

	<dc:abstract>QR decomposition of matrix is one of the important problems in the field of matrix theory. Besides, there are also so many extensive applications that using QR decomposition. Because of that, there are many researchers have been studying about algorithm for this decomposition. Two of those researchers are Feng Tianxiang and Liu Hongxia. In their paper, they proposed new algorithm to make QR decomposition with the elementary operation that is elementary row operations. This paper gives review of their paper, the analysis and numerical experiment using their algorithm, comparison with other existing algorithms and also suggestion for using other existing better algorithm that also has same features with theirs. Beside of them, we also compare all of these algorithms for some types of matrix. The result can be seen at this paper also. © 2012 Polish Info Processing Socit.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in monitoring and preventing heart attacks. In this paper, we propose a new method Adaptive Multilayer Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (AMGLVQ) that integrated feature extraction and classification for the automatic classification of heartbeats in an ECG signal. Since this task has specific characteristics such as, inconsistency optimization on feature extraction and classification, unclassifiable beats and a strong class unbalance, so in this study we proposed new algorithm to handle the problems. The algorithm will be evaluated on real ECG signals from the MIT arrhythmia database. The Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of classification better than SVM or back-propagation NN and also able to handle some problems of heartbeat classification: unbalance class, inconsistency between feature extraction and classification and detecting unknown beat on testing phase. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Particle filter for object tracking could achieve high tracking accuracy. To track the object, this method generates a number of particles which is the representation of the candidate target object. The location of target object is determined by particles and each weight. The disadvantage of conventional particle filter is the computational time especially on the computation of particle's weight. Particle filter with Gaussian weighting is proposed to accomplish the computational problem. There are two main stages in this method, i.e. prediction and update. The difference between the conventional particle filter and particle filter with Gaussian weighting is in the update Stage. In the conventional particle filter method, the weight is calculated in each particle, meanwhile in the proposed method, only certain particle's weight is calculated, and the remain particle's weight is calculated using the Gaussian weighting. Experiment is done using artificial dataset. The average accuracy is 80,862%. The high accuracy that is achieved by this method could use for the real-time system tracking.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Recent studies in matrix rank minimization problem has shown that a data matrix can be decomposed into low-rank and sparse matrix convex programming. This pattern of decomposition has wide range of applications, and also known as a form of Robust PCA method. In this paper, we focus on the face recognition application where the objective is to remove specularities which corrupt the images. This paper emphasizes that by using a quantitative image enhancement quality measure, an optimal low-rank approximation is obtained with lower dimensionality, shorter computational time, and comparable approximation quality compared with the approximation performed by the convex program. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Quality Undergraduate Education (QUE) project was initiated in 1996, commenced in 1997 and completed by September 2003. The project was funded by both the Government of Indonesia and World Bank and considered as a pioneering project scheme for improving the quality of undergraduate education in Indonesia. The project has primary objective of improving the quality of undergraduate education in meeting the demand of national as well as global market through the improvement of Relevance, Academic Atmosphere, Internal Management and Organization, Sustainability as well as Efficiency and Productivity or popularly known as RAISE. The awards were made in three rounds of free for all competition providing five-year developments grants. Each round competition involves a three stage peer review process: initial proposal, full proposal and site evaluation. The QUE fund has been utilized to support 46 study programs which are spread across 11 public institutions. The analysis on the quality of incoming students reveals that these grantees are amongst the best study programs in the countries. The rigorous monitoring and evaluation processes involving national as well as international peers clearly reveal that the project has been by and large successfully implemented where desirable outputs, outcomes and impacts are generally met. Considerable outcomes are primarily apparent in terms of improved external efficiency indicated by graduates capacity in meeting the job market in country as well as overseas, more efficient and productive internal process demonstrated by shortened length of study, improved GPA etc. During the period of this project significant institutional capacity buildings are particularly apparent amongst the higher education institutions receiving grants. In additions, various good practices engendered by the QUE have also improved the overall academic atmosphere especially at the grantee's level.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper we present a simulation environment for the study of hierarchical job scheduling on distributed systems. The environment provides a multi-level mechanism to simulate various types of jobs. An execution model of jobs is implemented to simulate the behaviour of jobs to obtain an accurate performance prediction. For parallel jobs, two execution models have been implemented: one in which the tasks of the job frequently synchronise and effectively run in lock step and a second in which the tasks only synchronise at beginning and end. The simulator is based on an object approach and on process oriented simulation. Our model supports an unlimited number of workstations, grouped into clusters with their own local resource manager (RM). Work is distributed over these clusters by a global RM. To validate the model, we use two approaches, analysing the main queueing systems and experimenting with real jobs to obtain the actual performance as a reference © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</dc:abstract>

Unfortunately, there were no scientific articles that conversing about the Russian bibliography. Should there were analysis, it can be used to reveal: a) the distribution of Russian bibliography based on its disciplines and subject areas, b) the dominance disciplines and subject areas, and c) subject areas that were the most copied. By using web crawler, we could harvest ¼ million records of Russian bibliography. We can analyze it by using some data mining methods. The results: a) about 85% (based on DDC) or 76% (based on LLC) of the bibliography were related to social sciences, b) the most used subject areas/headings were Soviet Union, Russia, Russia (Federation), Russian literature, and Economic history respectively, and c) three of the most copied books were about Operas, Russian language and Ballets-Scores. © 2019 IEEE</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Indonesian Government has announced several policies to mandate lecturers and students, the vast majority of Indonesian researchers, to publish scientific articles. The policies are considered very effective; it increased the quantity of Indonesian scientific articles tremendously. Unfortunately, we did not know the quality of the articles. The objective of this research is to assess the quality of Indonesian scientific articles. For comparison purpose, we also assess the quality of Indonesia neighboring countries scientific articles i.e. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. This research used three methods to assess the quality of scientific papers, they were data mining, bibliometrics, and scientometrics. The dataset used was mined from Scopus web database. The results of this research are: a) the quality of Indonesian scientific articles is the lowest, b) efficiency and effectivity of Indonesian scientific articles is low, and c) research fund is directly proportional to research quality. © 2019 IEEE</dc:abstract>

While many of multiple sensitive attributes researches do not set the sensitive attribute distribution. It is necessary for ensuring p-sensitive property since multiple sensitive attributes not just apply the model in single sensitive attribute. It needs more setting. This research discusses a distribution model to set sensitive attribute values when p-sensitive is applied on multiple sensitive attributes. We build a rule to distribute sensitive values. The result shows that this distribution model satisfies privacy guarantee that is provided by p-sensitive. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An accurate wind information forecasting plays the significant role for wind power system. However, the intermittent characteristic wind speed in nature over the time and from one location to another makes it hard to estimate the usagefactor o fwind farms. Therefore, actual long and short durationforecasting o fwind speed is necessary for wind power generation system efficiency. In this research, wepropose the method toforecast the wind speed data based on weather parameters including, temperature, sea level pressure, dew point, visibility, station pressure, rain intensity, optimum windspeed, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, hail intensity and thunder intensity data. All parameters were predicted using time series model, then the result o fpredicted data was implemented to predict the wind speed data. This research implemented radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) to predict the wind speed and the results were compared to univariate time series forecasting and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS SVM) algorithm. The result experimentally express better forecasting using RBF NN compared to two other models on the measures of MAPE, MSE and correlation coefficient. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Since coined by a German researcher in 2011, Industry 4.0 has piqued the interests of many researchers. The number of scientific publications related to Industry 4.0 or Fourth Industrial Revolution increases tremendously. Unfortunately, 90% of those publications have not been reviewed thus hindering many to track the progress and trends of research in this field. This article aims to address the most subject areas, top productive countries, the most influential authors, the most productive and influential journals/proceedings, the most used/influential keywords, and research trends related to Industry 4.0 based on documents indexed by Scopus. The method used is scientometrics and linear regression. It is revealed that Germany, China and Italy are the most prolific countries, but US, Portugal and UK are the most impactful countries. Researchers from China also dominate the top ten of most influential authors. The study prediction shows that Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Intelligent/Smart Manufacturing, Automation, and Big Data will dominate researches in 2018 and the next two years. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Information explosion that can be generated by anyone may lead to the spread of fake news not only at the news channel, but also at social media, and so forth. Detection of fake news has become an urgent need on the society because of fake news spread of unrest in the society. Several related studies have been conducted in the news classification with the aim of providing a decision whether a news is included in fake news or original news. In the related research, a vector representation of documents is used. This vector representation is then given to the algorithm for further processing. This study aims to model vectors that can accommodate the characteristics of fake news before further processed by language algorithms using the Indonesian language. In this research, fake news and original news are represented according to the vector space model. Vector model combination of frequency term, inverse document frequency and frequency reversed with 10-fold cross validation using support vector machine algorithm classifier. Variations of phrase detection as well as name recognition entities (entity recognition names) are also used in vector representation. A vector representation that uses the term frequency shows promising performance. It can recognize news characteristics correctly 96.74% of 2516 documents across phrase detection and named entity recognition process. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper intended to classify land cover of high-resolution satellite image using supervised classification method. The object of this research was the land cover image of the central Java area in Indonesia which chosen as an area observed with the cloud cover consideration. The Satellite image was obtained from Sentinel-2 through https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov. Supervised Classification and ArcMap 10.5 was used to classified image object. This research classified the land cover into four classifications class namely Water, Forest, Urban and Bare Land due to show the main classes in the Land Cover Classification of RSNI-l National Standardization Body of Indonesia, RSNI-l was used as reference for classification process. The confusion matrix used to calculate classification accuracy value. Subsequently, confusion matrix results compared to the truth information. The truth information was derived from the actual value of RASTERVALUE obtained from Google Earth. This research shown supervised classification maximum-likelihood classification has been classified land cover into four class (forest, water body, urban and bare land) with overall accuracy = 1 and kappa value = 0.4896. This result showed this research got moderate kappa accuracy value but high overall accuracy value. High accuracy value reached due to fully supervised experiment during classification process. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In our research, we found that there were no extensive study about library's collection in Indonesian language due to the lack of library of things metadata. As the consequence, the Government of Republic of Indonesia has no depiction of the output oflndonesian authors. The aim of this paper is to describe Indonesian bibliography by tools of visualization. In absence of the needed metadata of Indonesian book, we must gather those data ourselves. The method we employ for collecting data is using focused-web crawler. The crawler has collected about 1.48 billion items (holdings) in 25 million distinct titles in which 71 thousands titles were in Indonesian language. Novelty of this research is visualization of Indonesian bibliographic records by its subject headings and call number. By using scientometrics approach, we reveal that more than 90% of Indonesian publication are in social sciences mostly in the subject of Politics and Government, Economic History, Social Conditions, Indonesian Fiction, and Islam. The portion of exact sciences is about 8% which consists of Natural Sciences (1.26%), Medicine (1.26%), Agriculture (3.69%) and Technology (2.00%). © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The increasing amount of spatial data provides us with more useful information, either explicitly or implicitly or both. To obtain the implicit information in spatial data, this paper uses a certain technique in Data Mining especially Spatial Data Mining since spatial data is used, it is Co-location Patterns Mining. An example in the application of Co-location pattern mining area is in City management for retrieving Point Of Interest (POI) in proximity neighborhood of instances, such as finding what most instances or objects near hospitals or near a school. This paper evaluates the application of Co-location patterns mining using Event-centric model and Spatial Database using PostGIS to find Point Of Interest (POI). This paper uses DKI Jakarta province data from OpenStreetMap and evaluates 10 major instances on Jakarta. This paper compares two different PostGIS spatial query functions, ST-Dwithin and ST-Distance, to obtain neighborhood relationship in Co-location patterns mining process and to know which function is more efficient or faster. This paper states that ST-Dwithin is faster than ST-Distance and also obtain mosque-school has the biggest Co-location patterns based on Participation Index it has which means that the majority instance near a mosque on Jakarta is school. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Availability of vast amount of digital documents that have surpassed human processing capability calls for an automatic information extraction method from any text document regardless of their domain. Unfortunately, open domain information extraction (open IE) systems are language-specific and there is no published system for Indonesian language. This paper introduces a system to extract entity relations from Indonesian text in triple format using an NLP pipeline, rule-based candidates generator, rule-based token expander and machine-learning-based triple selector. We cross-validate four candidates: logistic regression, SVM, MLP, Random Forest using our dataset to discover that Random Forest is the best classifier for the triple selector achieving 0.60 F1 score (0.62 precision and 0.58 recall). The low score is largely due to the simplistic candidate generation rules and the coverage of dataset. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper aimed to present a formal representation design or classification concept to design relationships among real-world description into image description on a land cover domain using ontology approach. This paper focused on airport domain in Indonesia since detection of airport imagery features was an open challenge due to various features were used to describe the visual existence of an airport. Main characteristics of real-world definition for airport domain were identified by using the reference from Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan SNI 7645 Badan Standardisasi Nasional (Land Cover Classification SNI 7645 National Standardization Body) and Ministry of the Transportation Republic of Indonesia. Subsequently, image description of airport domain was defined based on the real-world description of the airport. This description used image features consideration namely spatial, spectral (color and texture) which was organized as ontological properties itself. At the end, the formal representation of airport domain was designed by mapping real-world description of an object into image description. This paper showed ontology approach could be used to design the formal representation of land cover by mapping real-world description of an object into image description. Ontology itself would be used for image identification/classification/clustering at airport domain or other image domains. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Communicating in short messages, such as using microblogs, was becoming more popular currently. Twitter https://twitter.com supports microblogs and retrieval of the blogs by users. To retrieve Twitter documents, we need specific strategies due to its specific characteristics. One new strategy for improving the effectiveness of twitter document retrieval is using the query expansion technique. This paper elaborates query expansion in twitter document retrieval by using the hashtag. We compared the effectiveness of query expansion in four different scenarios: The baseline result using no query expansion, highest scored- term in terms of frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf), maximum hashtag occurance, and combination of the highest scored-term and the maximum hashtag. The results show that the combination of the maximum term in tfidf and the maximum hashtag performs better in retrieving relevant documents than the baseline.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Ontology is widely used to represent knowledge in many software applications. By default, ontology languages such as OWL and RDF is built on discrete logic, so that it can not handle uncertain information about a domain. Various approaches have been made to represent uncertainty in ontology, one of which with a Bayesian approach. Currently, there are four published approaches: BayesOWL or OntoBayes, Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), Probabil istic OWL (PR-OWL), and Dempster-Shafer Theory. This paper provides a comparative study on those approaches based on complexity, accuracy, ease of implementation, reasoning, and tools support. The study concluded that Baye-sOWL is the most recommended approach to handle uncertainty in ontology construction among others. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Classification is a technique in data mining for categorizing objects. Text Classification is re-challenged for classifying very short documents or text as shown in social media collection. This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of classification on short documents. In this work, we expand words in every document before the documents are classified We use TFIDF model, Hidden Markov Model k-means clustering, and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for expanding documents. The results show that extending document term by just 1 word will increase its accuracy, while extending by 2,4, and 8 words tend to give stable results. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Mining data from a web database becomes more challenging in recent years due to the exploding size of data, the rising of dynamic web, and the increasing performance of web security. Mining data from a web database differs from mining data from web sites because it is intended to collect specific data from a single web site. Collecting a very large data in a limited time tends to be detected as a cyber attack and will be banned from connecting into the web server. To avoid the problem, this paper proposes a crawling method to mine web database faster and cheaper than conventional web crawlers. The method used is to run hundreds of threads from a single web crawler in a single computer and to distribute the threads into hundreds or thousands publicly available proxy servers. This web crawler strategy highly increases the speed of mining and is more secure than using single thread of web crawler. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Categorisation of digital documents is useful for organisation and retrieval. While document categories can be a set of unstructured category labels, some document categories are hierarchically structured. This paper investigates automatic hierarchical categorisation and, specifically, the role of features in the development of more effective categorisers. We show that a good hierarchical machine learning-based categoriser can be developed using small numbers of features from pre-categorised training documents. Overall, we show that by using a few terms, categorisation accuracy can be improved substantially: unstructured leaf level categorisation can be improved by up to 8.6%, while top-down hierarchical categorisation accuracy can be improved by up to 12%. In addition, unlike other feature selection models - which typically require different feature selection parameters for categories at different hierarchical levels -our technique works equally well for all categories in a hierarchical structure. We conclude that, in general, more accurate hierarchical categorisation is possible by using our simple feature selection technique.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>On the Web, browsing and searching categories is a popular method of finding documents. Two well-known category-based search systems are the Yahoo! and DMOZ hierarchies, which are maintained by experts who assign documents to categories. However, manual categorisation by experts is costly, subjective, and not scalable with the increasing volumes of data that must be processed. Several methods have been investigated for effective automatic text categorisation. These include selection of categorisation methods, selection of pre-categorised training samples, use of hierarchies, and selection of document fragments or features. In this paper, we further investigate categorisation into Web hierarchies and the role of hierarchical information in improving categorisation effectiveness. We introduce new strategies to reduce errors in hierarchical categorisation. In particular, we propose novel techniques that shift the assignment into higher level categories when lower level assignment is uncertain. Our results show that absolute error rates can be reduced by over 2%.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The time-dependent response of a floating flexible plate to an impulsively started steadily moving load defines the time taken to approach a steady-state deflection due to the load, or indeed whether such a steady state is achieved at all. The asymptotic analysis for large time reported here, for both a concentrated point load and a uniformly distributed circular load, confirms that a steady-state deflection is achieved at both subcritical and supercritical load speeds. This analysis also predicts a logarithmically growing response near the critical speed corresponding to the minimum phase speed of the hybrid waves generated, but an eventual steady-state response when the load speed moves at the shallow water wave speed. These results are supported by numerical computation.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An electrocardiogram signal is a recording of electrical activity at the heart. It is one of the most important signals and is widely used to diagnose abnormalities in the heart. However, it is weak and has a small amplitude, making it vulnerable to noise. One method used to reduce noise is to use the Nonlocal means method. This method has been proven to effectively reduce the amount of noise in an electrocardiogram signal. But the performance of the Nonlocal means method is strongly influenced by three parameters, namely bandwidth λ, patch half-width P, and neighborhood half-width M. In determining the three parameters, it is done manually so the results are not optimum. The analysis was carried out to determine the significance of the three parameters. Based on the results of the analysis it is known that parameter λ has a significant influence on the performance of the Nonlocal means method. If the λ value is too large, dissimilar patches will look similar which result in loss of information. Meanwhile, a small λ will produce a fluctuating signal which contains a lot of noise. Therefore, in this study, we propose an automatic determination of λ parameter to optimize the performance of the Nonlocal means method using the particle swarm optimization method. To measure the performance of the proposed method, we compare it to the state of the art methods such as Wavelet soft thresholding, Empirical Mode Decomposition soft thresholding, Nonlocal means, and modified Empirical Mode Decomposition and Nonlocal means. The results of our experiment showed that our proposed method achieved a better performance in the Mean Squared Error, Percent Distortion, and Signal to Noise Ratio Improvement. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

The selection of the most representative feature is an important task in big data analysis to reduce the dimension. The feature selection method is used to handle this problem. In this research, a homogeneous distributed ensemble feature selection method with 2-dimensional partition is used as new approach of feature selection. The results showed that the proposed method can improve the accuracy from the other feature selection method with an increase of 2% for several datasets.

	<dc:abstract>Multi object tracking is one interesting topics of computer science that has many applications, such as surveillance system, navigation robot, sports analysis, autonomous driving car, and others. One of the main task of multi-object tracking is data association. This study discusses data association on multi-object tracking and its completion with a two-layer network flow approach. Notice that each object on a frame as a node, then there is an edge connecting each node from one frame to other frame and then finding for the set of edges that provide the greatest probability of transition from one frame to the next, or in the optimization problem better known as max-cost network flow. The probability calculation is based on position distance and similarity feature between objects. The data used in this research is 2DMOT2015. The proposed method obtains highly competitive MOTA of 20.1% compared to existing method with fast computation speed by 215.8 fps. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, the broad availability of cameras and embedded systems makes the application of computer vision very promising as a supporting technology for intelligent transportation systems, particularly in the field of vehicle tracking. Although there are several existing trackers, the limitation of using low-cost cameras, besides the relatively low processing power in embedded systems, makes most of these trackers useless. For the tracker to work under those conditions, the video frame rate must be reduced to decrease the burden on computation. However, doing this will make the vehicle seem to move faster on the observer's side. This phenomenon is called the fast motion challenge. This paper proposes a tracker called dynamic swarm particle (DSP), which solves the challenge. The term particle refers to the particle filter, while the term swarm refers to particle swarm optimization (PSO). The fundamental concept of our method is to exploit the continuity of vehicle dynamic motions by creating dynamic models based on PSO. Based on the experiments, DSP achieves a precision of 0.896 and success rate of 0.755. These results are better than those obtained by several other benchmark trackers. © 2019 ETRI</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The number of accidents on highways is not only caused by heavy traffic but also by human error and lack of means for road safety supports. To overcome these problems, VANET technologies are applied. VANET acts as a crucial role in serving a high level of protection from danger and convenience to the users of the roads. Each vehicle in VANET is equipped with wireless networking devices and electronic sensors through which they can detect surrounding conditions and send appropriate information such as an emergency warning to neighboring vehicles. In VANET, routing protocols have important roles as their responsibilities to make sure that data are delivered to destinations via best-chosen routes properly and timely. This study aims to evaluate routing protocols for road safety applications which have high reliability in facing various obstacles and the frequently broken links. This research was conducted using simulation method which utilized software tools as follows: Network Simulator 2 (NS2) as a network simulator, OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a vehicle road infrastructure map, and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) as a traffic simulator. The simulation ran under Linux Ubuntu operating system. We undertook the experiments using Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) in various traffic conditions and simulation parameters on Jakarta toll road with realistic vehicle mobility models. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and End to End Delay (E2ED), which are commonly used as metrics for road safety applications, are measured to see the performance. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the result of measuring the electrical activity of the heart. Analysis of ECG signal is very useful for detecting abnormalities in the heart by a cardiologist. However, the results of the analysis are affected by the conditions of the Electrocardiogram signal. Electrocardiogram signal has the characteristics of nonstationary, nonlinear and susceptible to noise. This noise can damage the ECG signal, causing damage to the ECG signal which makes it difficult for the cardiologist to analyze the electrocardiogram signal. That noise can be sourced from respiration, mode movement, lack of electrode contact, and another electronic device. To overcome this problem, in this paper filtering is done to eliminate noise on ECG signals. The filter method developed in this study is based on Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (AFD). The ECG signal will be decomposed by that method into several components based on their energy distribution. Therefore, AFD has good performance in separate original ECG signal from noise that has different energy distribution. This AFD method is robust with computation time that is not much different from the Discrete Fourier transform method. To measure the performance of AFD based method, several tests have done by using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. Based on tests result the AFD method has a better performance on almost all recordings than the EMD and Wavelet Transform methods. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>According to the Indonesian Traffic Police Center, in 2017 Indonesia ranks the top 4th countries in South East Asia which has a high number of road accidents. Many of the accidents, unfortunately, are caused by the drowsiness of car drivers. This indicates that human fatigue significantly affects the safety of traffic. To decrease the number of road accidents in Indonesia, this research proposes an alternative measurement tool and parameter to detect the drowsiness symptoms of car drivers. This research analyzes the usage of a wearable wristband blood pressure and heart rate monitor, attached to a car driver to detect drowsiness. The proposed measurement tool monitors all retrieved data to measure the fatigue condition of the driver. The main purpose of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of proposed wristband to collect the blood pressure and heart rate pattern for indicating drowsiness symptoms. This research concludes that car drivers' drowsiness can be detected by monitoring their heart rate and blood pressure using the proposed wristband. This research can be expanded in the future as a mitigation system to prevent car accidents caused by drivers' drowsiness. It can be expanded as an integrated Internet of Things system in a smart car that can alert a driver to take a rest when the system indicates that the driver is in a fatigue condition. When this integrated system has been developed well, the car accidents caused by driver drowsiness can be effectively prevented so that the number of car accident victims in Indonesia will be minimized. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Vehicle detection is one of essential technology on Intelligent Transportation System. By detect the vehicle, we may know the presence and the number of vehicles on the road for some intervals of time. The challenge is the high dimensionality of features to represent a vehicle. To detect the vehicle, there are two processes, feature extraction and classification. The high dimensionality feature, which is produced on feature extraction step, make a heavy computation on the classification step. This research proposed a dimensionality reduction using Deep Belief Network (DBN) for vehicle detection. We try to detect cars and motorcycles. The feature extraction method is based on descriptive methods such as scaled invariant feature transform. DBN is used to reduce the high dimensionality features that is produced by descriptive methods. For classification task, we choose Support Vector Machine method. Moreover, UIUC dataset and our original data are chose to evaluate the proposed method performance. We are also compared DBN with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other method. The result indicates that using DBN as dimensionality reduction method performed better than PCA and others method in vehicle detection. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

Imbalanced data is a special problem in classification task where the class distribution is not uniformed. Resampling (SMOTE and ENN) is employed to improve the classifier performance. Four metrics is applied for performance evaluation i.e., precision, recall, specificity, and F-1 score. Based on the experiments, Bagging has a superior performance compared to baseline classifiers (Naïve Bayes and Log Regression) and other ensemble learnings (Boosting and Random Forest). In addition, the combination of SMOTE and ENN successfully increase the classification performance and avoiding biased to the majority class. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

A good analysis of these data can lead to new knowledge about the present situation as well as the future insight. While many advantages could be obtained from these large data, the issue on how to run the Machine Learning on a large dataset as effective and efficient as possible remains an open problem. In this paper, data processing simulation using machine learning algorithm ofLinear Regression is conducted to learn from Bitcoin trading dataset. The simulation is carried out in Apache Spark cluster architecture and GPU. The running time and error of the algorithm implementation in both architectures are compared with each other. The simulation results show similar error performance between Apache Spark cluster and GPU. Yet, Apache Spark can run the simulation faster than GPU. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>High dimensional data will cause problems in classification tasks and storage. Hyperspectral image is a 3D image with hundreds of spectrals. A dimensional reduction method is required to solve problem. PCA is a well known and common method for reducing data dimension. However, the standard PCA needs to be extended in order to improve its ability in hyperspectral image classification. From the previous study, PCA have limited capability on extracting information from the spectral in hyperspectral image. In this study, we propose a new method to improve PCA performance: as a feature extraction method and a dimensional reduction method. We have inserted a hidden layer to transform the data into a new dimension and used PCA to extract the information. The experiment was conducted using Indian Pines hyperspectral image which contains 200 spectrals. We also use datasets from UCI repository such as Iris and Seed datasets. The results showed that the proposed method is able to increase the standard PCA performance and it is comparable to Nonlinear PCA. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>MicroRNA(miRNA) expression that have great potential serving as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets generally has a very large number and has brought great challenge for identification of the most feature sets. In this paper, combinatorial miRNA biomarkers from the diagnostic set and feature selection are comprised for breast cancer classification using Naive Bayes and backpropagation. The diagnostic set of miRNA are provided from recent bioinformatics and medical research results. Moreover, greedy stepwise using Naive Bayes and Multi Layer Perceptron method are utilized for feature selection in order to reduce number of miRNA set from 1881 features. MiRNA expression in Cancer and normal breast cells are examined to study this comparison. The classification performance of input sets were implemented and studied thoroughly in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity, Classification Accuracy and ROC value. Based on experimental results, this study obtained recommended features for cancer classification with less number than diagnostic sets and in this study, the essential features for cancer analysis are discovered as new essential biomarkers. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Background: The existing data show high maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate in Indonesia compared with those of several Asian countries. The aim of this study is to apply medical science and technology to improve the public health level. Methods: The study carried out in 8 sub-district public health centers randomly selected in Center of Jakarta that included survey on knowledge, attitude and behavior among patients as ECG and USG users, survey on ECG and USG in use, survey on the existing communication or transmission and survey through interview on ECG and USG operators. In addition, literature study about the regulations on telemedicine, international collaboration with Malaysia. Results: Due to limited utilization of ECG on public health centers for only medical checkup so that survey on characteristics of patients with heart disorders was not done. ECG data transfer using internet network applied by Harapan Kita Hospital-RSJPDHK for only emergency cases, whereas this study performed for only early detection. Several obstetricians felt objection if USG data taking was made by midwifes. It would be better, in their opinion, if trained general practitioners who did the USG data taking. International collaboration with Malaysia was formed. Conclusion: System, operational and regulation need development. Training on data taking and introduction of such program to consulting obstetricians. Manufacturing prototype of ECG and USG adaptor. Written agreement (memorandum of understanding) between service provider and system provider. International collaboration with Malaysia was realized. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Cardiovascular system is the most important part of human body which has role as distribution system of Oxygen and body's wastes. To do the job, there are more than 60.000 miles of blood vessels participated which can caused a problem if one of them are being clogged. Unfortunately, the conditions of clogged blood vessels or diseases caused by cardiovascular malfunction could not be detected in a plain view. In this matter, we proposed a design of wearable device which can detect the conditions. The device is equipped with a newly neural network algorithm, GLVQ-PSO, which can give recommendation of the heart status based on learned data. After the research is conducted, the algorithm produce better accuracy than LVQ, GLVQ and FNGLVQ in the high level language implementation. Yet, GLVQ-PSO still has relatively worse performance in its FPGA implementation. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of machine learning problem that is difficult but important to be addressed is imbalanced data where particular data is recessive while the others are dominant. Most of classifiers performance significantly degraded when dealing with imbalanced data. The major approaches to tackle imbalanced data are cost sensitive learning which modifies the classifier and resampling which modifies the data distribution. In this research, we employed generated oversampling method (GenOMe) that generate new data point with a particular distribution as a constraint. We examine three distribution functions: Beta, Gamma, and Gaussian distribution. We use Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes as classifier to assure the robustness of GenOMe. The experimental results shows that GenOMe outperforms classification using original data and classification using SMOTe (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) data. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Visual tracking is the process of locating, identifying, and determining of an object within video frames. From a Bayesian perspective, this is done by estimating the posterior density function. On the other hand, evolutionary optimization perspective would like to generate and select sufficiently optimize solution using two major components: diversification and intensification. This research will develop visual tracking algorithm using a Bayesian approach with evolutionary optimization in order to perform accurate tracking. The main idea is to combine Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Particle-MCMC) as representation of Bayesian approach, with evolutionary optimization that is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in each video frame. The visual tracking is regulated by Particle-MCMC filter algorithm and PSO will work within this filter to get more accurate tracking. Based on the dataset groundtruth, we found the accuracy of tracking can be increased considerably comparing to our previous research. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This research aims to improve the capability of semantic segmentation through data perspective. This research proposed a parameterized Conditional Random Fields model and learns the model by using Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM). The SSVM utilizes Hamming loss function for optimizing 1-slack Margin Rescaling formulation. The joint feature vector is derived from energy potentials. Variation of image size produces some missing values in the joint feature vector. This research shows that a zero padding can resolve the missing values. The experiment result shows that prediction with parameterized CRF yields 75.867% global accuracy (GA) and 22.1410 % averaged class accuracy (CA). © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In orthodontics, the malalignment of teeth could be measured using many types of indexes. The Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index is one of the most common indexes in Orthodontics which has a 98% validity, especially from the occlusal surface. Many researchers use a PAR ruler to measure the PAR Index manually. The aim of this study is to compare the duration between the manual and digital measurement of PAR index in a system based on the 2-dimensional (2D) image. Materials &amp; methods: The 110 dental casts in octagonal base form pre-orthodontic treatment were scanned to get the digital image data. Eleven components of PAR index of 110 dental casts in octagonal base form pre-orthodontic treatment were calculated manually and digitally. Both of duration were compared with the paired t-test. Result: The time consuming of manual measurement was 378.01 seconds and digital was 177.05 seconds. The paired t-test comparing to systems were significant (p=0.001). The average difference of 3 PAR index scores in assessing the same study model, that shows Digital is more thorough at 3 PAR parity score. Discussion: The paired T-test has been performed to the 11 PAR index component. A digital measurement of 11 PAR component is reliable and faster than using a measurement manually by model studies. The 2D image is clearer so that point determination is easier hence the measurement time is faster. Conclusions: It is a solution and recommended for the orthodontist to consider of using PARIndex system as one of the alternative tools to have a faster PAR index measurement. © 2017, University of Dicle.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The objective of this paper is to present a novel method, based on a swarm intelligence algorithm, for ellipse detection in digital images of embryo. The process is carried out in several stages. First, edge detection is performed on the image. Then, line segments in the image are detected, and potential elliptical arc segments are extracted from the line segments. Afterward, the detection process is carried out using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, which utilize the calculation of the fitness function from the arc segment previously detected. The PSO technique, which is the idea behind the proposed algorithm, is used to find the actual ellipses by combining potential elliptical arcs. The best combination of potential arcs is determined by means a voting technique that utilizes three important points on the arc, namely the starting point, midpoint, and endpoint, so the voting is more efficient than doing the voting for every single pixel in the image. Furthermore, this method is used an embryo image that has following the characteristics: multiple ellipses, a lot of noise, an incomplete ellipse, low image contrast, and overlapping cells. Experiment show that the proposed method detects the ellipses better than do several voting-based ellipse detection methods such as RHT, IRHT, and PSORHT. On the other hand, the experiments show that the proposed method has a higher average hit rate than do other methods. This research is used to increase the success rate of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF).</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Semantic segmentation is an image labeling process for each pixels according to defined objects class and its presence in an image. Labeling process consists of recognizing, detecting location and labeling pixels that defines the object in the image. Annotation result of semantic segmentation needs ground truth to verify accuracy of score prediction. Therefore, this research propose a model to predict score of annotation accuracy. By casting the problem into constraining object boundary recognition, we described the annotation using foreground mask. To extract the feature, we used convolution neural network. We only used CNN trained on a image level annotation. In order to be able to infer the pixel instance, we adapt CNN architecture into weakly supervised learning. Experiments were conducted by finetuning Convolution Neural Network for object recognition using weakly supervised architecture for multilabel classification. In this paper we proposed to score semantic segmentation based on bag level information without the availability of pixel level annotation. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we present a technique for visual tracking in the field of Human Sperm motion. Application of sperm cell tracking is mainly important in Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), a medical procedure that has enabled the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) of a single sperm which is injected directly into an egg. In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking single object in video sequences of human sperms and a newly developed Smoothing Stochastic Approximate Monte Carlo (SSAMC) based tracker enhanced by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The problem for this research is that the motility or movement of Human Sperm is fast and unpredictable. In addition, each and every sperms have closely similar size and shape. To solve this problem, we used PSO for searching algorithm (finding the best target) in a Search Window, it can reduce the search space in every each consecutive frame. The measurement results of the proposed method are then compared with the manual measurements done by experts. The experiment results were conducted on both open video data and our own video data. Experiment results showed that the proposed method can handle our specific problem in human sperm cell tracking, and give us a better result as compared to our previous tracker, which used geometric transition dynamic model and without any enhancement by PSO. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

We utilize linear prediction between the beats to exploit the high correlation among those beats. This method can optimize the redundancy between adjacent samples and adjacent beats. Predictive coding is the next step after beat reordering step. The purpose of using predictive coding is to minimize amplitude variance of 2D ECG array so the compression error can be minimize. The experiments from selected records from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database shows that the proposed method is more efficient for ECG signal compression compared with original SPIHT and relatively have lower distortion with the same compression ratios compared to the other wavelet transformation techniques. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One promising approach to pixel-wise semantic segmentation is based on conditional random fields (CRFs). CRF-based semantic segmentation requires ground-truth annotations to supervisedly train the classifier that generates unary potentials. However, the number of (public) annotation data for training is limitedly small. We observe that the Internet can provide relevant images for any given keywords. Our idea is to convert keyword-related images to pixel-wise annotated images, then use them as training data. In particular, we rely on saliency filters to identify the salient object (foreground) of a retrieved image, which mostly agrees with the given keyword. We utilize saliency information for back-and-foreground CR-Fbased semantic segmentation to further obtain pixelwise ground-truth annotations. Experiment results show that training data from Google images improves both the learning performance and the accuracy of semantic segmentation. This suggests that our proposed method is promising for harvesting substantial training data from the Internet for training the classifier in CRF-based semantic segmentation. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.

	<dc:abstract>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been widely utilized for Odor Source Localization (OSL) purposes.There have been plenty of researches on this field. The latest research to modify original PSO were on the utilization of wind dynamics. In wind utilization research, the robot movement would be retarded if the robot movement direction is similar to the wind direction. Conform to the aforementioned method, this research proposed new modification on the global best term of PSO algorithm. There are two modifications proposed in this research, named Ignoring gBest 1 (IgB1) and Ignoring gBest 2 (IgB2).The basic concept of two proposed methods are identical by considering wind dynamic into global best term of PSO. The robot which in the original PSO will move to global best position would be deviated to the other point which is defined by deliberating wind direction. The main difference of both the method lies on the addition of new term in IgB1, whereas in IgB2 there is modification in social term without any additional term. The experiment was conducted on two PSO for OSL purposes algorithms i.e. Ranged Sub-Group PSO (RSPSO) and Ranged Multi Niche PSO (RMNPSO). The result on RMNPSO showed significant decrease in time consumption while employing both the proposed method. On the contrary in RSPSO the improvement is insignificant compared to the original algorithm.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a method which is used to help couples who have a fertility problem. One of the problems of IVF is the success rate, which is only about 30%. One cause of the problem is the embryo morphology observation done by embryologist manually. Morphologically normal embryo does not mean the embryos are genetically normal. The aforementioned phenomena can be tested by using time lapse recording in which unavailable in the manual observation. Therefore it is very important to establish method for time lapsed recording of the embryos. This can be done by automatic observation on the embryo image, where the first step is to create a system that can automatically detect the embryo. This paper proposed Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method based on Arc Segment to automatically detect embryo.From the experiment that have been conducted, the proposed method can detect single and multiple ellipse on embryo with a better accuracy than the previous method, EDCircles by 6% and 3% for single and double respectively.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Odor sensing technology in robotic research introduce two research field namely odor recognition and odor source localization. Odor source localization research also includes the odor recognition ability with localization method. This paper shows some experiment had been done to localize odor source using single agent and multiple agents. Experiment shows that single agent can't be used in dynamic environment, hence also can't be used in real life application. This paper promotes an algorithm known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to solve these problems. The experiment conducted using PSO shows that PSO able to localize the odor source in the same condition where single agent failed. However, PSO still need to be modified before it can be use widely. This paper shows modification that has been proposed by the authors to enhance it's ability. The research also has been push to solve multiple odor sources using parallel localization. To verify proposed method, software simulator was used. Results from these experiment show that Modified PSO is able to localize all four odor sources in dynamic environment in 651.900 seconds within 7 x 7 meters search area. The modification being applied in this research not limited by searching technic but also creating two types of robot.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the combination of transportation systems with Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In Jakarta traffic, there is unique issue that does not arise in developed countries: very large number of motorcycles. Nevertheless, the enabling technologies for the detection, measurement, recording, and information distribution of motorcycle have not been fully developed in the existing researches. With the above considerations, we establish research which aimed to develop enabling technology especially in here for tracking motorcycle using camera. This paper is presented our proposed tracker which called as Geometric Deep Particle Filter (GDPF) for tracking motorcycle using camera. The tracker is inspired by human visual perception which has nonretinotopic nature. Based on particle filter approach, our goal is to improve the transition model in order to overcome motorcycle maneuver. We will exploit this curved nature of the state space using geometric computing theory, such as Lie groups, and Lie algebras. A number of experiments have been conducted for this research, and it has been found that GDPF has achieved certain degree of success in object tracking.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The quality of a semantic annotation is typically measured with its averaged class-accuracy value, whose computation requires scarce ground-truth annotations. We observe that humans accumulate knowledge through their vision and believe that the quality of a semantic annotation is proportionally related to its compatibility with the vision-based knowledge. We propose a knowledge-compatibility benchmarker, whose backbone is a regression machine. It takes as input a semantic annotation and the vision-based knowledge, then outputs an estimate of the corresponding averaged class-accuracy value. The knowledge encodes three kinds of information, namely: cooccurrence statistics, scene properties and relative positions. We introduce three types of feature vectors for regression. Each specifies the characteristics of a probability vector that captures the compatibility between an annotation and each kind of the knowledge. Experiment results show that the Gradient Boosting regression outperforms the n-Support Vector regression. It achieves best performance at an R2-score of 0.737 and an MSE of 0.034.

	<dc:abstract>Particle filter has appeared as a useful tool for visual object tracking. The efficiency of the particle filter depends mostly on the number of particles used in the estimation. This paper would like to measure the efficiency of particle filter via the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD). The basis of the method is similar to Fox's KLD-sampling but implemented differently using resampling. The benefit of this approach is that the underlying distribution is exactly the posterior distribution. By means of batch KLD-resampling, we measure the efficiency of several dynamic models by calculating the average number of needed samples. Using experiments, we found (i) the efficiency of particle filter can be measure reliably enough using batch KLD-resampling, (ii) dynamics models affect the efficiency of particle filter, but their performance depends mostly on the case by case situationally. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:type>Conference Paper</dc:type>
	<dc:source>Proceedings - ICACSIS 2014: 2014 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems</dc:source>
	<dc:abstract>In this paper we present a technique for ellipse detection in digital images based on swarm intelligence algorithm and arc segment combination. The proposed method is then used as embryo quality scoring assessment during the first 24-48 hours since its morphological structure can be approximated by ellipse. The idea of the proposed algorithm are based on combining possible arcs for the ellipse shaped objects and try to find the best combinations using Particle Swarm Optimization technique to find the actual ellipse. The process involves detecting line segments in the image and then followed by arc segment extraction from lines to get potential elliptical arcs. The detection process is then guided by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) by utilizing the calculation of the fitness function from the arc segment that had been detected previously. The measurement results of proposed method are then compared with manual measurements. The experiment results were conducted on both synthetic data and real embryo images. Experiment results showed that the proposed method is better than several ellipse detection methods such as RHT, IRHT, and PSORHT to detect ellipses on the image. Another advantage of our proposed algorithm compared to the Hough Transform variants is that it can be used for multiple ellipse detection. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, a new codebook based learning method, Adaptive Multicodebook Fuzzy Neuro Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (FNGLVQ), is proposed. The main contribution of this paper is the use of multi codebook which is adaptive in nature to the distribution of the data. The number and position of the codebook is determined through clustering approach. In this research, a decision tree based clustering, CLTree, is used to cluster the data to get the initial placement of the codebook. The advantage of using CLTree against other clustering method is CLTree do not need the number of cluster as initial input. In average, this method improves the accuracy rate of Mitra data 3 and 4 class 2% and 2.12%, respectively compared to the single codebook approach. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper proposes a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for multimodal function in a dynamic environment, with approaches, that uses inertia weight and change of the social component that is proportional to the number of iterations of the particle swarm. In multimodal case, PSO is expected to be able to find global and local optima, and to avoid trapped particles in the local optima before finding global optima. This study proposes the use of a parallel niche (sub swarm), with each niche having its own best value optima, and does not share these values. In dynamic environment case, PSO should find the optima value in every change of fitness function. Previous research has introduced detect and response method as a PSO solution for dynamic environments. This study proposes placing randomly sentry particles to detect the occurrence of changed fitness function for phase detection. Responding phase is done by searching optima value using improving velocity formula in social only mode. The weight of social component is accelerated to converge towards the optima value and decelerated to diverge by a sinusoidal function with period 0 and phi, and the inertia speed will be accelerated to the opposite direction. Finally, the algorithm has been tested using a benchmarking formula and it has shown a better result. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In the recent years, it has become readily more accepted that smart mobile phones with GPS or A-GPS enabled device, or even Cell-ID enabled, among the commuters, can be used as traffic sensor, which complements other traditional sensors. This development is pursued in the efforts of reducing or avoiding traffic jams. Consequently, this paper attempts to find a novel way to map match 2D local map with actual GPS traces from mobile phones. From a number of experiments, it has been found that Virtual Detection Zone method can be used to obtain 100% map matching, as it ensures matching by comparing the GPS data to a set of pre-determined check points (circular VDZ, preferably with a radius of 50-185m). Furthermore, from this study, it is proposed to increase privacy, firstly by using OTP to doubly-lock the sensor's data. Secondly, by ensuring that valid data is only delivered from a significant distance of the user's private locations, and thirdly, by splitting the data to two parts before using OTP. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Fetal head detection and approximation from ultrasound image is an important method in obstetric and gynaecology. In this research, we propose a modification of an efficient algorithm to detect an ellipse shape in an image. Our proposed method is using an efficient way to approximate an ellipse based on its minor axis. By enumerating every possible minor axis from a pairs of pixels, other ellipse parameter can be estimated. For verifying the ellipse approximation result, a voting mechanism is conducted to vote the most appropriate set of parameters for an ellipse. Instead of using every edge pixels in the image, we randomize the pixels to gain speed improvement. We test the algorithm using two different data. The first one is real ultrasound image and the second one is synthetic image which has been populated with salt noise. The ultrasound image is cleaned from speckle noise using Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SRAD) algorithm. The experiment gives satisfying result in both of synthetic and real images. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, a portable, easy to use, and real-time sleep stage classification device is presented. A simpler approach using raw features of ECG signals for sleep stage classification has been developed. Only one lead of ECG signal is required for operation which makes the device easily operable and only requiring user to attach 3 electrodes to the body. The device is constructed with singleboard computer and electronic circuits with Surface-Mount Device (SMD) technology making it small in size and highly portable. Classification can be done real time with an average delay of 20 seconds. Two sleep stages, namely the Awake and Non-Wake Sleep, can be differentiated by Random Forest algorithm. Data from the MITRA database was used for training and testing. Data from one patient was left out from the training set and used for testing. The device's recognition has high performance with weighted average value of 0.941 for Precision and value of 0.942 for Recall. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Commonly sleep stages detection can be done using electroencephalogram (EEG) that is recorded in hospitals using Polysomnography (PSG) systems. PSG not only records brain signal but also electrocardiogram (ECG). In this paper an automatic sleep stages detection using FNGLVQ algorithm based solely on ECG signal is reported. We have compared two neural network algorithms' accuracies and implemented algorithms with the best accuracies into Field Programmable Gate Array. The two algorithms were Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) and Fuzzy Neuro Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (FNGLVQ). The result shows that FNGLVQ is capable in achieving 68% accuracy for MIT-BIH data, and 70% accuracy for Mitra data. The experiment conducted on FPGA also shows similar result. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Sleep is an essential phase in human circadian rhythm with importance in restoring human vigour and vitality. Conventional sleep examination is done using Polysomnography with many sensors connected to various parts of human body. Recently, research in sleep is geared toward alternative feasibility of using only ECG signal. In this research, sleep stages classification using only features derived from single-lead ECG is conducted. The capability of Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) in discriminating sleep stages is tested. We showed that GLVQ which is configured with multi codebooks shows promising result in discriminating complex sleep stages data. © 2012 Universitas Indonesia.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>One of the important critical traffic controller challenges is the management of multi-intersection networks and real-time control system. In this paper, we develop a coordinated traffic signal control system based on a distributed self-organizing control. We propose a new modeling methodology which deals with left-right turns based on traffic signal phasing, multiway intersection and fuzzy logic to adapt the alternation of saturation flow in self-organizing control. We design a simulation which can generate real-time traffic flow sequence. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller is better than the method in conventional traffic or previous model. © 2011 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper provides a combination of chemotaxic and anemotaxic modeling, known as Odor-Gated Rheotaxis (OGR), to solve real-world odor source localization problems. Throughout the history of trying to mathematically localize an odor source, two common biometric approaches have been used. The first approach, chemotaxis, describes how particles flow according to local concentration gradients within an odor plume. Chemotaxis is the basis for many algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The second approach is anemotaxis, which measures the direction and velocity of a fluid flow, thus navigating "upstream" within a plume to localize its source. Although both chemotaxic and anemotaxic based algorithms are capable of solving overly-simplified odor localization problems, such as dynamic-bit-matching or moving-parabola problems, neither method by itself is adequate to accurately address real life scenarios. In the real world, odor distribution is multi-peaked due to obstacles in the environment. However, by combining the two approaches within a modified PSO-based algorithm, odors within an obstacle-filled environment can be localized and dynamic Advection-Diffusion problems can be solved. Thus, robots containing this Modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MPSO) can accurately trace an odor to its source. © 2007 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The odor distribution Advection-Diffusion environments in obstacle environment have been developed. In real world the odor distribution are changing over time and multi peaks especially in obstacle environments. The purpose of developing this environment is to bridge the gap between the very complex hard to understand real-world problem (odor dispersion model) and all too simple toy problems (dynamic bit matching or moving parabola). Modified Particle Swarm Optimization is a well-known algorithm, which can continuously track a changing optimum over time. We will adopt two types of PSO modification concepts to develop a new algorithm in order to control autonomous vehicles to solve odor source localization in real world environment. Firstly, PSO can be improved or adapted by incorporating the change detection and responding mechanisms for solving dynamic problems. Secondly, Charged PSO, which is another extension of the PSO, has also been applied to solve dynamic problems. In order to control autonomous vehicles in more realistic condition from the viewpoint of robotic, where a speed limitation of the robot behavior and collision avoidance mechanism should be taken into consideration as well as the effect of noise and threshold value for the odor sensor response, also positioning error of GPS sensor of robot. Simulations illustrate that the new approach can solve such dynamic environment in Advection-Diffusion odor model problems even though in obstacle environments. © 2006 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a problem of odor source localization in a dynamic environment, which means the odor distribution is changing over time. Most work on chemical sensing with mobile robots assume an experimental setup that minimizes the influence of turbulent transport by either minimizing the source-to-sensor distance in trail following or by assuming a strong unidirectional air stream in the environment, including our previous work. However, not much attention has been paid to the natural environment problem. Modification Particle Swarm Optimization is a well-known algorithm, which can continuously track a changing optimum over time. PSO can be improved or adapted by incorporating the change detection and responding mechanisms for solving dynamic problems. Charged PSO, which is another extension of the PSO, has also been applied to solve dynamic problems. Odor source localization is an interesting application in dynamic problems. We will adopt two types of PSO modification concepts to develop a new algorithm in order to control autonomous vehicles. Before applying the algorithm for real implementation, some important hardware conditions must be considered. Firstly, to reduce the possibility of robots leaving the search space, a limit to the value of velocity vector is needed.

	<dc:abstract>An electronic odor discrimination system had been developed by using four quartz resonator-sensitive membranes basic-resonance frequencies at 10 MHz as a sensor and analyzed the measurement data through a back propagation (BP) as the pattern recognition system. The developed system showed high recognition probability to discriminate various single odors to its high generality properties; however, the system had a limitation in recognizing the fragrances mixture. This system also had other disadvantages, such as classifying the unknown category of odor as the known category of odor. In order to improve the performance of the proposed system, development of the sensor and other neural networks (NNs) are being sought. This paper explains the improvement of the capability of that system. In this experiment, the improvement is conducted not only by replacing the last hardware system from four quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies at 10 MHz with new 16 quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies at 20 MHz, but also by replacing the pattern classifier from BP NNs with the variance of BP, probabilistic NNs, and fuzzy-neuro learning vector quantization (FNLVQ). Matrix similarity analysis (MSA) is then proposed to increase the accuracy of the FNLVQ, to become FNLVQ-MSA neural systems in determining the best exemplar vector, for speeding up its convergence. The purpose of the recent study is to construct a new artificial odor discrimination system for recognizing the fragrance mixtures, in addition to recognizing the unknown fragrance mixtures. The use of new sensing systems and FNLVQ-MSA has produced higher capability, compared to the previously mentioned system. © 2005 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

Authors have developed an electronic odor discrimination system by using 4 quartz-resonator sensitive membranes as the sensors and had fundamental resonance frequencies 10 MHz. In recognizing and classifying the output pattern, the system used Back Propagation (BP) neural network as the pattern recognizer. This system can recognize the limited odor mixtures. The capability of the system can be amended by improving the hardware and changing the software of pattern classifier. This paper proposes a new sensing system using 16 multiple quartz resonator sensors array and basic resonance frequencies 20 MHz. Also modify various neural network called Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Fuzzy-Neuro Learning Vector Quantization (FLVQ) as the automated pattern recognition system. The purpose of the recent study is to construct an artificial odor discrimination system for recognizing the fragrance mixtures. It is found out that the using of new sensing system as in PNN and FLVQ produces higher capability compare to the conventional sensing system with Back Propagation (BP) neural network. © 2004 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>An artificial odor recognition system has been developed recently. However, recognizing the odor mixture is rather difficult by the use of a limited number of sensors. We have constructed an artificial odor recognition system based on 16 sensors of 20 MHz quartz resonators. Various neural systems, i.e. backpropagation neural system, probabilistic neural system and fuzzy-LVQ, are then studied and applied as the neural classifier of the developed system. Results of experiments confirmed that the F-LVQ shows higher recognition rate compared with that of two other neural systems. Improving the F-LVQ is then conducted by incorporating the matrix similarity analysis to form FLVQ-MSA, showing the highest average recognition rate of 80% on determining three-mixture odors. © 2002 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Fuzzy neural networks are gaining much research interest and have attracted considerable attention recently, due to diverse applications in such fields as pattern recognition, image processing and control. However, this type of neural system, similar to that of multilayer perceptrons, has a drawback due to its huge neural connections. In this article, we proposed a method for optimizing the structure of a fuzzy artificial neural network (FANN) through genetic algorithms. This genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the number of weight connections in a neural network structure, by evolutionary calculation of the fitness function of those structures as individuals in a population. The developed optimized fuzzy neural net is then applied for pattern recognition in an odor recognition system. Experimental results show that the optimized neural system provides higher recognition capability compared with that of unoptimized neural systems. The recognition rate of the unoptimized neural structure is 70.4% and could be increased to 85.2% in the optimized neural system. It is also shown that the computational cost of the optimized neural system structure is also lower than for the unoptimized structure. © 2002 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The human sensory test is often used for obtaining the sensory quantities of odors, however, the fluctuation of results due to the expert's condition can cause discrepancies among panelists. Authors have studied the artificial odor discrimination system using a quartz resonator sensor and a back-propagation neural network as the recognition system, however, the unknown category of odor is always recognized as the known category of odor. In this paper, a kind of fuzzy algorithm for learning vector quantization (LVQ) is developed and used as a pattern classifier. In this type of fuzzy LVQ, the neuron activation is derived through fuzziness of the input data, so that the neural system could deal with the statistics of the measurement error directly. During learning, the similarity between the training vector and the reference vectors are calculated, and the winning reference vector is updated by shifting the central position of the fuzzy reference vector toward or away from the input vector, and by modifying its fuzziness. Two types of fuzziness modifications are used, i.e., a constant modification factor and a variable modification factor. This type of fuzzy-neuro (FN) LVQ is different in nature from fuzzy algorithm (FA) LVQ, and in this paper, the performance of FNLVQ network is compared with that of FALVQ in an artificial odor recognition system. Experimental results show that both FALVQ and FNLVQ could provide high recognition probability in determining various known categories of odors, however, the FNLVQ neural system has the ability to recognize the unknown category of odor that could not be recognized by the FALVQ neural system. © 2002 ISA - The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society.</dc:abstract>

In this type of FLVQ, the neuron activation is derived through fuzziness of the input data, so that the neural system could deal with the statistical of the measurement error directly. During learning, the similarity between the training vector and the reference vectors are calculated, and the winning reference vector is updated in two ways.

	<dc:abstract>Data are important assets of organizations and define their businesses or functions. Data needs to be governed and controlled so that it goes to the proper owner. Well-defined data management can help organizations maintain the quality of their data. This study took the IT Bureau of Audit Board of State as a study research. The study assesses its maturity level and recommend how the board can benefit from learning it. This study used Stanford Maturity Model as the framework tool to assess practices of data governance in IT Bureau of audit board. The maturity assessment is performed by assessing both IT Bureau staffs and top echelons. After validation and finalization assessment, the result showed that most maturity components had average maturity level of 2.63. It means the IT Bureau of Audit Board already has high-level data governance meta-policies which are considered as best practices (between level 2 and 3). The data governance components that can be improved in the future are stewardship and metadata on capabilities dimension and policies dimension. © 2019 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

This research investigates how ridesharing applications in Indonesia protect their customers' personal data. By using self-regulation mechanism and compliance examination with related national regulation, this research is demonstrated to three ridesharing applications in Indonesia through their privacy policies, terms, and conditions. Generally, this research unveils that all core principles of Data Protection have been fully covered by them. It shows that the application operators have established formal commitment to protect their customers' personal data which have been shared after vendor approves the customer's booking. Unfortunately, they cannot ensure that shared information are fully erased from vendor's device after transaction. They also do not expose their compliance to national regulation although most of stipulation have been covered. © 2018 IEEE</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The emergence of online and new digital media such as mobile applications and social media changed the retail business model and its consumers behaviors. These changes bring new challenges for companies and their stores to manage various channels. This phenomenon creates new idea to integrate them into Omni-channel services. It requires the readiness and complex maintenance because each channel has different characteristics. The consumers find difficulties in ensuring their transactions to be accurate and trustable. This study aims to analyze the factors that influence consumers to use Omni-channel services. It adopts the UTAUT2 with two new variables, such as personal innovativeness and perceived security. The quantitative approach is demonstrated using PLS-SEM with 168 respondents. As the results, social influence variable becomes the most influencing factor on purchasing intention in Omni-channel services, followed by performance expectation, and security perception. These factors become priority when a company formulates strategies for its omni-channel. © 2019 IEEE. All Rights Reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>About 90% of startup implementation in Indonesia failed due to the products and markets incompatibility and the funds that run out. The Agency of Creative Economy targets to reduce failure rate to 70% because startup delivers numerous contributions to boost the digital economy. In order to achieve the target, a holistic understanding of factors that influence startup’s sustainability becomes a fundamental baseline. This research aims to identify and analyze those factors with the mixed method approach. Literature review and expert judgment are combined to provide the conceptual model with 11 hypotheses in 5 dimensions: Finance, Organization, Product, Market, and External Environment. The research found there are 10 factors identified, 1 factor namely Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the significant factor influencing business sustainability in the digital startup based on the PLS-SEM result. The complete results have been affirmed by the expert judgment as part of triangulation process. By leveraging those factors, startup can perform the necessary strategies to develop their business and avoid the failure. © 2019 IEEE. All Rights Reserved.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Personal Data Protection is governed by the laws of the Republic of Indonesia. The regulation must also be obeyed by motorcycle ride-sharing service. It is important to know the customers’ perception of personal data protection since it will affects the customers’ intention to provide their personal data when using the services. An analysis was conducted using quantitative methods and PLS-SEM to determine this case. 253 ride-sharing customers were hired as respondents who tested by several variables: privacy violation experiences, privacy concerns, risk beliefs, trusting beliefs, and behavioral intentions. As the results, a personal data violation experience does not negatively affect customers’ privacy concerns. However, the privacy concerns do not negatively affect the level of customers’ trust and the desire to provide personal data. It has a positive effect on the potential perceived risk. This study recommends ride-sharing providers to develop their data protection, improve privacy policies, and provides access control for customers. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Startups with a platform-based business model generates self-employed people despite its possibility to cause a disruption. The technical workers who work independently in a "gig economy" create new jobs that are expected to reduce the unemployment rate. Several startups are failed and must be closed although they have received some funding from investors. In 2015, there were 20 startups in Asia that failed and had to be closed, which seven of them were from Indonesia. In 2017, there were six startups that had to be closed. The purpose of this research is to analyze startup sustainability with the platform based business model in Indonesia. This research is conducted using qualitative method with semi structured interview model to the founders or C-level of startup with platform based business model in Indonesia. The result shows there are six main themes that affect the platform based startup sustainability: startup ecosystem, human resources, investors, finance, products, and competitors. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Patient’s master data is an important data for hospital’s operational. If the master data quality does not meet the expectation, it will affect the billing process and then will affect the income for the hospital. Master data management can help the hospital to integrate all their master data they have so for each data there will be only single source of truth and validity of data will be complied. By doing assessment of master data management maturity, hospital will be able to identify what aspect of master data management that they lack so the process can be improved as well as the quality of master data. Assessment of master data management maturity level is done using Master Data Management Maturity Model (MD3M) oleh Spruitz and Pietzka. The assessment showed 90% of activity related to master data management has been implemented. Some policies need to be implemented regarding to the master data management, such as documentation of the policies and the definition of master data, formal appointment of the data stewards, and the implementation of master data quality management. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

	<dc:abstract>Certification Authority (CA) must unveil its Certificate Policy (CP) and Certification Practice Statement (CPS) as obligatory and fundamental documents to describe its technical information security, business processes, and legal compliance. Although had been initiated since 2014, Indonesia National Public Key Infrastructure (INPKI) still cannot be operated completely by Root CA, Sub-CA’s, and other involved participants. This situation affected by CA’s inability to produce adequate CP and CPS that cover necessary information required above. As Root CA in INPKI, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) shall propose CP and CPS for itself and also provide CP and CPS framework for its Sub-CAs. Previously, Sub-CAs confronts difficulties to propose CP and CPS due to their low proficiency. Using the concept of knowledge management, MCIT needs to regulate and educate Sub-CAs and itself as Root CA by proposing CP and CPS as knowledge transfer and guidelines. Proposed CP and CPS become empirical externalization and internalization so that each CA can compose its own CP and CPS with decent content to cover the required issues. This research explores how CAs in INPKI formulates their CP and CPS based on Request for Comment (RFC) 3647 with larger point of view. This exploration aims to extend and criticize whether the proposed CP and CPS are qualified to encourage the CA’s readiness and the preparation of INPKI. This exploration contributes significant impact through preparation of CP and CPS. Produced CP and CPS will be more qualified and enhanced in unveiling necessary information to obtain trustworthiness in three aspects: governance; technical; and human resource requirements. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT &amp; LLS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) requires Information System/Information Technology (IS/IT) to accelerate its bureaucratic reform. By shortening business legalization process, performance transparency, and standardization of open-access public data, MEMR is expected to improve public service as government institution. However, current situation indicates low performance of IS/IT at MEMR. MEMR has many IS applications with similar functions, separated infrastructure, and weak IT governance. This research explores Strategic IS Planning (SISP) for MEMR as formal development guideline of IT policies, technical tactics, and IT roles. Formulation of SISP is guided by three business principles: Automation, Continuity, and Standardized. SISP is developed using a methodology which accommodates four layers: IT governance, IS application, IT infrastructure, and IT human resources. The methodology is also supplemented with Enterprise Architecture modeling and some COBIT 5 processes through cascading mechanism. This research produces some agendas for each layer, such as IT steering committee establishment to engage top-management commitment, IT competence improvement, centralized data center and disaster recovery center to simplify IT infrastructure operational, and also integration of similar functions IS applications (from 146 IS applications to 22). Through SISP, MEMR can perform more capable bureaucratic reform using IS/IT. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Data Center (DC) has important role due to its main function to support various IT services. To ensure that the DC operates properly, it is important to have a proper management of DC and therefore need to be evaluated. Since, there was no specific guideline in evaluating DC management, the goal of this research is to develop guideline for DC management evaluation by deriving from from the existing DC standards. This research is a qualitative research using two approaches: case study and action research. It begins with selecting management aspects from DC standards (ANSI/TIA-942 and ANSI/BICSI-002) which then classified by DC components. BPS-Statistics Indonesia is selected as the case study for this research. Current condition of the DC at BPS-Statistics Indonesia is observed and evaluated based on the developed guidelines which then followed by a set of recommendations. The result of this research is the evaluation guideline that can be used as a basis for evaluating DC management. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) is a government institution that has the task of conducting affairs in the field of energy and mineral resources to assist the President in running the state government. Eventhough the role of Information Technology (IT) is increasingly important, MEMR still has no guidance in planning and implementing IT solution. Each unit design and implement their own IT solutions without considering integration to other units. As a result, MEMR faces variety of IT implementation. This study aims to map the current condition of MEMR and recommend the architecture design that fit to MEMR. The framework used is The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). Data were collected through documents of MEMR and also interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with units in MEMR. The results of the study are the architecture principles of MEMR that include business principles, application principles, data principles and technology principles and also pattern of solutions and roadmaps based on the proposed architecture principles. © Medwell Journals, 2017.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education (MRTHE) is actively improving its information security to enhance public service. Employee's awareness on information security requires attention due to their contribution on the improvement. MRTHE should identify characteristics of employees on information security through Information Security Awareness (ISA) level measurement. Such characteristics could provide adequate analysis as consideration to establish feasible programs of ISA for employee. This study concerns to ISA level measurement for MERTHE's employee using seven focus areas of information security (password management, email usage, internet usage, social networking site usage, incident reporting, mobile computing, and information handling) with three variables of KAB model: Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior. They are expanded into some criteria to examine employee's individual perception using Likert scale. As a result, 13 parameters out of 21 are classified as Good level of ISA. General score as representation of all parameters is 81.07 percent. It indicates that MRTHE's employee has performed positive knowledge, attitude, and behavior on information security. To enhance quality of measurement, this study conducts three hypotheses that actualized relationship among each variable. Since their relationships are proven empirically using regression linear examination, these hypotheses are acceptable. It reflects that on information security, knowledge has good influence to attitude and behavior while attitude also has good influence to behavior. Hence, MRTHE can initiate improvement of information security using programs with knowledge-based. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Certificate Policy (CP) and Certification Practice Statement (CPS) are mandatory documents for Subordinate Certification Authorities (Sub-CAs) to explain their process business in Indonesia National Public Key Infrastructure (INPKI). Due to Sub-CAs' low proficiency in preparing CP and CPS, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) need to formulate CP and CPS framework for them. The usage of Request For Comment (RFC) 3647 as standard of CP and CPS format should be complemented with statements to comply with legal aspect of information security in Indonesia. This compliance explained in the relevant of provisions in CP and CPS. The research will contribute the acceleration of Sub-CA's readiness in CP and CPS requirements, both in technical and legal aspect. Sub-CAs CP and CPS are important in gaining trust from government as regulator and citizen as subscriber. This research provides guidance for Sub-CAs to compose sufficient CP and CPS related to three aspects: Governance, technical, and human resources requirements.

	<dc:abstract>As IPv4 capacity is running out, it is an obvious need for changing to next generation IP technology which is IPv6. This study aims at analyzing the factors that support the acceptance of network users to use IPv6. This study analyzed user experience of users who comes from academic background, enterprise practitioners, and also internet service providers. Key factors on the success and failure of IPv6 deployment were synthesized from findings from those audiences. This research utilizes mixed method, qualitative and quantitative approach. Focus group discussion chosen for the qualitative approach while survey to 286 respondents using Likert scale is being used as the data collection method for the quantitative approach. In the focus group discussion, there were experts who are working in government institutions, service providers, universities, and also network practitioner communities. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) guidelines are followed for better end results. Findings upon data collected and processing along with the information gathered from focus group discussion reveal several significant factors which affect IPv6 implementation project such as experience, facilitating condition, system trust, social influence, perceived of usefulness and perceived ease of use. Based on the findings, there are recommendation for the ISP to change the mindset and strategies for the implementation of IPv6 is totally different from IPv4 in terms of capacity, complexity, and the way of handling incident or service interruption. To provide clear reference and guidance for IPv6 transition and implementation, government is expected to collaborate with the network providers, academia, community, and practitioners to develop set of standards and detailed transition roadmap. Subsidy program to upgrade the network infrastructure that supports IPv6 should also be considered by the government in annual budget planning. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>According to 2015 Performance Reports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Percentage of Information Technology Master Plan Implementation performance falls into the poor category. Through root cause analysis, it is identified that the KPI's poor performance is caused by the evaluation of information technology (IT) governance has never been performed. By performing such evaluation, the organzation's status of IT governance can be determined, and then based on the status constructs the recommendations for improvement. COBIT 5 framework was used in this study as a frame of reference for assessing the capability level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' IT governance, prioritizing and constructing the recommendations for process improvement. The assessment of process capability using Process Assessment Model (PAM) generates an average rating of 0.7, where 1 process is at level 2 (managed), 15 processes are at level 1 (performed), and 21 processes are still at level 0 (incomplete). Prioritization using pain points yields 15 prioritized processes for immediate improvement. The recommendations for improvement are constructed using the provided COBIT 5's guidance, in the form of activities and best practices for each IT process. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Studies to rank e-Government were already performed by various organizations, aimed at measuring the level of success in e-government implementation within a country. A successful implementation in one country may not be directly applicable for adoption by other countries. There is no consensus of factors that significantly influence the success of e-government implementation. On the other hand, investment in e-government is increasing year by year. Using principal component analysis approach, the study explores the components of successful e-government implementation in Indonesia. The components identified from the analysis will be used in the formula to measure the level of e-government implementation. © 2014 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In a previous study, we proposed a government Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework called eGovAMAN. This framework accommodates variety of G2G relationships among sectoral and regional governments that can ensure the commonality and specificity of Indonesian e-government application. The eGovAMAN consists of the Policy, Interoperability and Operational layer. In this paper, we exercise the government certification authority (GCA) for electronic government procurement (e-GP) system in order to evaluate the eGovAMAN layers. At the end of this work, we improve our framework in order to accommodate possible case similar to GCA for e-GP. We enhance the Interoperability layer by defining new domain that we called 'application driven PKI domain'. We also define a new element 'leading sector agency' in the Policy layer. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

It is based on our work in developing efficient algorithms that outperform the best available frequent pattern algorithms on a number of typical data sets. We discuss improvements to the data structure design that has resulted in faster frequent pattern discovery. The performance of our algorithms is studied by comparing their running times on typical test data sets against the fastest Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth and Opportune Project algorithms.

	<dc:abstract>The classification problem in data mining is to discover models from training data for classifying unknown instances. Associative classification builds the classifier rules using association rules and it is more accurate compared to previous methods. In this paper, a new method named CSFP that builds a classifier from strong frequent patterns without the need to generate association rules is presented. We address the rare item problem by using a partitioning method. Rules generated are stored using a compact data structure named CP-Tree and a series of pruning methods are employed to discard weak frequent patterns. Experimental results show that our classifier is more accurate than previous associative classification methods as well as other state-of-the-art non-associative classifiers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Efficient mining of frequent patterns from large databases has been an active area of research since it is the most expensive step in association rules mining. In this paper, we present an algorithm for finding complete frequent patterns from very large dense datasets in a cluster environment. The data needs to be distributed to the nodes of the cluster only once and the mining can be performed in parallel many times with different parameter settings for minimum support. The algorithm is based on a master-slave scheme where a coordinator controls the data parallel programs running on a number of nodes of the cluster. The parallel program was executed on a cluster of Alpha SMPs. The performance of the algorithm was studied on small and large dense datasets. We report the results of the experiments that show both speed up and scale up of our algorithm along with our conclusions and pointers for further work. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In this paper, we present an algebraic specification for association rule queries that can form the foundation for integrating data mining and database management. We first define a set of nested algebraic operators needed to specify association rule queries. Association rule discovery is then expressed as a query tree of these operators. The expressiveness of the algebra is indicated by specifying some of the variants of association rule queries as query trees. Other variants of association rule queries discussed in the literature can also be represented using the algebra. Constrained association queries (CAQs) have been proposed by researchers to limit the number of rules discovered. We discuss the representation of CAQs using the algebra. Certain sequences of algebraic operators occur together in most of the query variants. These sequences are combined as modules to simplify the presentation of query trees. While the focus of the paper is the algebraic specification of association rule queries, we briefly discuss the optimization issues in implementing the algebra for association rule mining. The grouping of algebraic operators into modules facilitate the use of existing algorithms for association rules in query optimization.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Twitter is one of the social media that has been widely used for various purposes, especially to facilitate the means of information, communication, entertainment and a means of expressing expression. We can find various kinds of information on twitter such as culture, sports, culinary, tourism, music, politics and others. The purpose of this research is to build an application that can group tweets from twitter into sports and non-sports categories using the Naive Bayes classifier method. Text mining is a technique used to handle classification, clustering, information extraction and information retrieval problems. To classify tweets from twitter automatically needed one of the mining Clustering text techniques. Learning outcomes in the form of probabilities will be used as material for processing tweet documents that are not yet known in the category. In the process, the tweet document will go through a text pre-processing process, and grouped into unigram (one word), bigram (two words), trigram (three words). For determining the category of a tweet document that is not yet known, the comparison is made between the results of the appearance of the categories of the three n-grams. From the results of testing the system using 100 to 2000 training data in each category, and 10 testing data in each category. The result is the accuracy of tweets that are categorized as 60% in training data as much as 100, accuracy of 65% in training data as much as 200, and accuracy of 90% in training data as much as 2000. The conclusion is that the more training data used as learning increases also the success rate of clusters to a tweet document. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Modestum Ltd., UK.

	<dc:abstract>There is no definite information among ulama, about the beginning of the Prophet's hadith forgery, but this problem has spread and responded to the community. The purpose of the hadith counterfeiters are various motives and motivations, the factors that encourage them to falsify the hadith are to defend certain interests: defending political interests, defending theology, defending fiqh madzhab, attracting people who hear their stories, to dignify others, encourage others are more persistent in worshiping and destroying Islam. Determining the level of hadith requires a long process because we have to read the entire hadith and know the perawi and sanad. This problem requires a solution to overcome it. Through this research, search and analysis of the model was carried out using the Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm and the Decision Tree algorithm (C4.5). Evaluation is done by comparing two algorithms. Based on the results of the study found that the Decision Tree Algorithm (C4.5) has a higher accuracy rate of 7.81% of the Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Modestum Ltd., UK.

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia is rich in cultural heritage. Based on BPS data in 2015, there were 6238 intangible and 1413 tangible cultural heritage [1]. Ironically with this great wealth, the 2014 Podes survey shows that Indonesian participation in cultural visits and cultural performances is very low (5-15%) [2]. So it is not surprising that about 127 of Indonesian intangible cultural heritage are on the verge of extinction, one of which is the result of the low level of cultural socialization among the community. Cultural socialization can actually be done through internet media considering that the public's exposure to devices and the internet is increasing year by year[3]. However, the cultural data available on the internet has not been integrated so that it cannot be optimally utilized. Data on cultural heritage is currently spread to many parties: cultural institutions such as museums; cultural community; and individuals. Data on cultural heritage in individuals are prone to be lost if it is not stored and/or inherited. The problem is, how to collect data that is spread everywhere and then store it in a structure that can answer questions such as the number of cultures that exist, statistics, cultural distribution regarding geographical location, and kinship relations between one culture and another. Facing this problem, crowdsourcing is a solution opportunity that allows data collection from many parties. Crowdsourcing is a new way of utilizing human resources spread throughout the world to do certain jobs. The low-quality problem of crowdsourcing technology can be handled by combining crowdsourcing systems with automatic classification algorithms or with procedure or algorithm to select the appropriate worker due to their performance. In this study, a crowdsourcing machine will be built to collect heritage cultural data from various sources. The collected data is stored in an ontology format that can answer questions: statistics on cultural data, number of current cultures, geographical distribution of cultural objects, and intercultural kinship. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The growth of information in the last two decades is dominated by multimedia data such as text, image, audio, and video. Multimedia data with low-level features should be represented in a high-level concept that is easily understood by a human. Classification of the multi-format object is a technique that is used to represent a multi-source object like text, image, audio, and video at once. The object t features are extracted then categorized in several specified classes or concepts. This paper adopts Deep Learning Techniques: (1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques for classifying an image, audio, and video, (2) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) technique for classifying text. The experiment uses small data of Indonesian cultural heritage domain. As supervised learning form, the output model is grouped into five classes based on Indonesian ethnic groups (Toraja, Bali, Batak, Dayak, Betawis. The result, this classification model can be implemented in the Multimedia Information Retrieval System and Recommender System for Indonesia Cultural Heritage. © 2018 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Given the importance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to economic development, both academics and policy makers have been interested in measuring the progression of SMEs' e-business adoption. Numerous ebusiness 'stage models' for SMEs have previously been proposed to track such progression. However, there remain a few issues with these models. Previous models tend to be too linear and prescriptive of certain e-business applications for SMEs. The problem with this is that SMEs do not necessarily adopt application in linear fashion and given the diversity of SMEs, some applications may not be relevant for some SMEs. In addition, most of these models tend to overlook secondary value chain activities that support an enterprise. We thus proposed a model that attempts to address these issues. The proposed model, called the e-business triangle model, attempts to depict SMEs' adoption of e-business in non-linear way and categorizes them into new groups of activities, namely support activities, primary activities, integrated activities and analytics activities. To apply the model, we conducted a personally administered survey in two industries, trade and services, depicting different e-business adoption patterns between them. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The richness of Cultural Heritage and Natural History is abundant. Many of the cultural heritage collection in Library, National Archive, and Museum in the form physical object or digital format in a different type of media (text, image, audio and video). One cultural heritage object can have the relationship with other objects in different media format and do not mention query term explicitly. Using the various media format causes problems in search. A monolithic search engine like Google, Bing, Google Image, Youtube, or Findsounds only retrieve one media format. Besides, the search result of the existing search engine is less relevant and incomplete in searching cultural heritage. Several multimedia information retrieval techniques used in building the relationship using ontology like ontology based search, content-based search with ontology and hybrid search with ontology. This paper proposes Concept-based Multimedia Information Retrieval System (MIRS) with ontology using Indonesia's cultural heritage dataset to increase relevance and completeness of the system. Concept-based MIRS using manually built thesauri or by extracting latent word relationship and concept from the Ontology that provides definition and formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and its relationship in cultural heritage documentation. Ontology-based Semantic similarity measure is defined which measure the semantic relationship between document based on the likeness of their meaning. The search results indicate that the document being retrieved becomes highly relevant, more complete, enrich the keyword and in varying media formats when is compared to existing search engine results such google, bing, google image, youtube and findsounds in specific domain. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>In recent years the explosive growth of information affects the flood of information. The amount of information must be followed by the development of the effective Information Retrieval System (IRS) so that the information will be easily accessible and useful for the user. The source of Information contains various media format, beside text there is also image, audio, and video that called multimedia. A large number of multimedia information rise the Multimedia Information Retrieval System (MIRS). Most of MIRS today is monolithic or only using one media format like Google1 for text search, tineye2 for image search, youtube3 for video search or 4shared4 for music and audio search. There is a need of information in any kind of media, not only retrieve the document in text format, but also retrieve the document in an image, audio and video format at once from any kind media format of the query. This study reviews the evolution of IRS, regress from text-based to concept-based MIRS. Unified Multimedia Indexing technique is discussed along with Concept-based MIRS. This critical review concludes that the evolution of IRS follows three paces: content-based, context-based and concept-based. Each pace takes on indexing system and retrieval techniques to optimize information retrieved. The challenge is how to come up with a retrieval technique that can process unified MIRS in order to retrieve optimally the relevant document. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Electronic health records are expected to improve the quality of care provided to hospitalized patients. Electronic documentation implementation is a course of action that requires much time and attention. The study aimed to explore and describe the usability and satisfaction of using electronic documentation. Quantitative and descriptive qualitative research methods were done through focus group interviews involving eight nurses and a questionnaire survey to 219 nurses. Satisfaction before and after the implementation of the system was compared using thematic analysis and paired t-test. The system was developed with NANDA, NIC and NOC language and named as "SIMPRO". The results yielded themes on perception about usability, positive and negative responses, barriers to and expectations for successful implementation. SIMPRO was found to increase the nurse satisfaction and usability (p = 0.001). Training on the motives for change might strengthen the nurse's motivation and facilitate the transition to a new system. The study findings implied that electronic nursing documentation was an effective way to improve nursing documentation. In addition, support from the leader and organization might affect the effectiveness of the system implementation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The explosion of digital data in the last two decades followed by the development of various types of data, including text, images, audio and video known as multimedia data. Multimedia Information Retrieval is required to search various type of media. There is comprehensive information need that can not be handled by the monolithic search engine like Google, Google Image, Youtube, or FindSounds. The shortcoming of search engine today related to their format or media is the dominance of text format, while the expected information could be an image, audio or video. Hence it is necessary to present multimedia format at the same time. This paper tries to design Unified Concept-based Multimedia Information Retrieval (UCpBMIR) technique to tackle those difficulties by using unified multimedia indexing. The indexing technique transforms the various of media with their features into text representation with the concept-based algorithm and put it into the concept detector. Learning model configures the concept detector to classify the multimedia object. The result of the concept detector process is placed in unified multimedia index database and waiting for the concept-based query to be matched into the Semantic Similarities with ontology. The ontology will provide the relationship between object representation of multimedia data. Due to indexing text, image, audio, and video respectively that naturally, they are heterogeneous, but conceptually they may have the relationship among them. From the preliminary result that multimedia document retrieved can be obtained through single query any format in order to retrieve all kind of multimedia format. Unified multimedia indexing technique with ontology will unify each format of multimedia. © 2017 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The role of e-business or the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for business activities in advancing sustainable industrial development is well acknowledged. As one of the key drivers in manufacturing growth, e-business can potentially enable increased productivity and industrial competitiveness. The adoption of e-business in remanufacturing, an emerging strategy in sustainable manufacturing, has been lagging especially among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. SMEs face challenges in capitalizing on growth opportunity in remanufacturing, which include demand forecasting and inventory management. These challenges, if left unaddressed, could pose threats to SMEs business viability. Exploratory in nature, this study presents the state-of-the-art in e-business for remanufacturing industries including accounts on the hurdles that contribute to the lack of adoption. A number of factors have been identified as potential hurdles to adoption include, among others, knowledge and competencies in e-business and financial support. To address the issue of lack of adoption, potential strategies are also discussed. Furthermore, a value chain analysis of a remanufacturing SME is used to provide latest insights into how e-business applications portfolio could be used to counter aforementioned challenges faced by remanufacturing SMEs. © 2016 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Personalization is an alternative to improve the learning process for an e-Learning environment. It is a useful strategy to adjust the student' needs based on their characteristics to make learning more effectively. In this study, we propose the step-function approach for personalization in e-learning. It provides the students with adopting the knowledge-ability factor (Novice, Average, or Good category) that matches with their learning materials levels (Level1, Level2, or Level3). The approach implemented into an e-learning which called SCELE-PDE and used as the experimental group in two stages with different scenarios. In the first, without a step-function approach, but the SCELE-PDE can identify an initial of student's ability to knowledge category. The second stage has used the approach to providing students with personalization in e-Learning to adapt learning material based on a knowledge category. As a result, the step-function approach has successfully to improve the student performance in the learning process during the course. Thus, the approach has shown an increase in the level of students' knowledge. So, it can be used as a guide when designing an e-learning personalization for students to enhance learning and achievement.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Naturally every individual is unique. Thus, learning process in every learner is also different. On the other hand, education requires every learner to achieve a certain standard of competency. Standards are made to ensure all learners meet the defined learning outcome. In order to help learner achieve the targeted competency based on their own pace and way of learning, we propose personalized e-learning architecture that complies with standard. This study explores various theories and best practices of e-learning and confronted with various ways of learning due to cultural diversity in Indonesia. The analysis reveals components that commonly play important part in personalization: integrated learning structure, learner model, personalized learning scenario, personalized content selection, and portfolio-based assessment. These five components are interrelated to compose personalized e-learning system. The proposed architecture facilitates various ways of learning as well as aligns with expected learning outcome. A prototype system of the proposed architecture will be built in future to show the contribution. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The effectiveness of the system and information technology within an organization is no longer an issue. Rather, it proves to have a high correlation with business performance. On the other hand, the planning process, which is cost-effective and aligned with business processes itself, is not an easy task. Based on perspective analysis of strategic information system planning (SISP), there are at least five themes being discussed: organization and business impact, case study, key's success factor, approach and framework development, and government best practice. From these themes, we find three categorization process of developing SISP. First category, Strategic Alignment and Business impact that focus on business strategy implementation to achieve competitiveness. Second category, Approach and Framework Development that focus on current needs of specific area. Third category, Evaluation of Readiness and Success Factor that focus on tasks and functions to improve organization performance. According to these categories, we propose a collaborative framework that integrate business strategy, current needs, task and functions into IT and Business Vision. This collaborative framework strengthens the alignment of business strategy and IS strategy through IT and business vision, that support by levels of readiness in order to improve competitiveness. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) contribution to the economic growth of a country is widely acknowledged. The shift of consumer's consumption habits from offline to online demands SMEs to adopt e-business. SMEs, on the other hand, despite all the benefits that e-business could offer, have been slow to adopt it. Adding to adoption pressure is the trade liberalization around the world that necessitates some use of e-business to trade internationally. Conducted in the context of an emerging economy, this preliminary study explores the relationship between international orientation of SMEs and e-business adoption. In addition, as implementation cost has been cited to be one of the top barriers of e-business adoption in emerging economies, this study investigates the relationship between financial support received by SMEs and their adoption. A sample of 90 SMEs in manufacturing sector was selected as the unit of our analysis. The resulting analysis reveals that SMEs with international orientation show tendency to adopt e-business whereas those that receive financial support, contrary to much of the existing literature, indicate no inclination to adopt. The result implies that internationalization of SMEs in the emerging economy may have more influence on their readiness to adopt e-business than financial assistance. © 2015 Infonomics Society.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often described as the engine of growth for a country's economy due to their significant economic contributions. At the same time, ebusiness offers an opportunity for SMEs to significantly further their growth as it has been identified as a tool that could improve an enterprise's operational efficiency and competitiveness in the global market. Despite the promised potentials of e-business, its adoption among SMEs has been lower compared to that of larger enterprises. This study offers a multifaceted overview of the existing research by initially summarizing and then critically analyzing a range of research frameworks and evaluating the extent to which they take into account the nature of SMEs and their ability to provide a practical tool to transform SMEs. Our analysis reveals three groups of issues that may affect e-business use in SMEs: 1) Factors that drive and hinder adoption of ebusiness among SMEs; 2) Profiling of SMEs based on their capacity or readiness to adopt e-business; and 3) Implementation models that are inherently centered on specific technologies or ebusiness applications. Our overall analysis shows that the existing e-business frameworks, when used independently, inadequately explain the adoption behavior of the diverse SMEs and insufficiently provide a practical tool for SMEs in implementing e-business. Accordingly, this study suggests preliminary ideas towards an integrated e-business for SMEs framework. © 2015 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Indonesia is a developing country that began to utilize information technology in education. A form of its implementation is the use of e-learning. However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study proposes architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score. Based on the test results and evaluation showed that the availability on Cloud-Based Open Learning further meet user needs. This is indicated by the presence of a simple infrastructure services, application services with just one stage and the availability of a wider range of data and the resource sharing. In accessibility, Cloud-Based Open Learning provides easy access to the user. By economically, the result of evaluation showed that Cloud-Based Open Learning has an investment of 35.61% efficiency, increase Return On Investment (ROI) of 60.95% and Net Present Value (NPV) of 81.97% from the user's perspective.

	<dc:abstract>The present study proposes the hypothetical validation of the relationship between key success factors and ERP implementation success. There are twenty KSFs considered in this study which were chosen from literature review. The success of ERP implementation can be measured through five indicators, namely: system quality (SQ), information quality (IQ), service quality (SEQ), tactical impact (TAI) and strategical impact (STI).There are 248 respondents who represent 37 companies and 10 industrial sectors that responded to the questionnaire. The respondents are staff at management level, IT staff and users involved in the development and use of the ERP system. Based on hypothetical validation, the ERP implementation can be success when all of independent variables (x1...x2D) have value of S (satisfied) or when any of (x1...x2D) have value of NS or S. If any of (x1...x2D) have value of NS, then the other factors that have a significant influenced to ERP system implementation success must have value of S in order to gain a successful of ERP system implementation. The ERP implementation is absolutely failed, when all of independent variables have value of NS (not satisfied). There are several limitations in this study, where the degree of ERP implementation for each company is not the same in terms of the number of module implemented, ERP system product used, and so forth. Further, the companies involved in this study have different numbers of years in using ERP system. This study is expected to improve knowledge in ERP implementation, especially the validation of the relationship between key success factors and ERP implementation success.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Geographically, Indonesia is vast and consists of various religion, ethnicity, and culture. The condition makes any challenges to deliver educational services equally. As we know, educational services in Indonesia centralized in Java. Indirect, it has been made digital divide and knowledge gap. These challenges is playing role as a trigger to bring on low quality of Human Index Development, Education Index Development, Global Competitiveness, and Quality of Life index. Therefore, in this study we proposed design of Cloud Education as an alternative solution to enhance educational services distribution. The study consisted of several stages including: identifying problems and needs, determine the service model, design of Cloud Education, implementation, testing, and last is evaluation. The results of simulation tests indicates that the educational stakeholder has many services models among others: (1) application services such as: e-Learning, e-Library, e-Lab, e-Academic, and e-Course, (2) data services such as: learning materials, library collections, scientific publications, student identity, lecturers profile, and higher education profile, (3) infrastructure services such as virtual storage. Meanwhile, all of services on Cloud Education can be accessed using any devices such as mobile phones, computers, and tablet computers. In the future, we would like implement this prototype in real world, discuss policy and regulation, and also study Cloud Education benefit in financial aspect. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The increasing research in the areas of information technology have a positive impact in the world of education. The implementation of e-learning is one of contribution from information technology to the world of education. The implementation of e-learning has been implemented by several educational institutions in Indonesia. E-Learning provides many benefits such as flexibility, diversity, measurement, and so on. The current e-learning applications required large investments in infrastructure systems regardless of commercial or open source e-learning application. If the institution tended to use open source e-learning application it would need more cost to hire professional staff to maintain and upgrade the e-learning application. It can be challenging to implement e-learning in educational institutions. Another problem that can arise in the use of e-laerning trend today is more likely to institution building their own e-learning system itself. If two or more institutions are willing to build and use an e-learning so they can minimize the expenditure to develop the system and share learning materials more likely happened. This paper discuss the current state and challenges in e-learning and then explained the basic concept and previous proposed architectures of cloud computing. In this paper authors also proposed a model of cloud-based e-learning that consists of five layer, namely: (1) infrastructure layer; (2) platform layer; (3) application layer; (4) access layer; and (5) user layer. In addition to this paper we also illustrated the shift paradigm from conventional e-learning to cloud-based e-learning and described the expected benefits by using cloud-based e-learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Nowadays, personalization e-learning becomes one of the interesting issues in e-learning research that continues to grow. Many studies proposed different approach to deliver adaptive learning content according to learner's characteristics, needs, and preferences. The outcomes from studies are various too. In this paper, in order to get best approach in task deliver learning content, preliminary study to analyze two major approaches that usually used, they are text mining and ontology approach has been conducted. Both approaches will be applied in a personalization e-learning system. The effectiveness and efficiency to obtain which approach is the best will be measured. In order to support the study, data such as learning material, participant, and learning activities have been collected and analyzed. © 2013 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The nature of Indonesian Government spreads over 70 sectoral and 530 regional government agencies in a very vast geographical area. Hence, to maintain the quality of government services (G2G, G2B, G2C) post such a challenge. These services still scattered among government agencies with silo system. A lot of resources being waste, synchronization is lacking, and interoperability is impossible. Over all government performances are declined and bureaucracy reform is slowing down. This study proposes cloud-based e-government architecture. The architecture consists of six layers: user, access, service, management, virtualization, and infrastructure layers. The access layers accommodate various technological access devices in order to widening users' access. Initial experimental result shows that the implementation of cloud-based e-government architecture can improve cost-saving of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) investment. © 2012 ACM.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>With such rapid growth of technology, the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in teaching and learning process at schools indicates upward trend. Nevertheless, there is still no clear indication to what extent such technology has been applied. In light of that, it is necessary to set a method capable of measuring the adoption level of ICT at schools. This measurement covers some focus areas ranging from infrastructure readiness, application, competency, utilization, etc. These four focus areas have been attached with distinct weights for this measurement. Each focus area also includes some factors. Focus area of infrastructure has some factors, including electricity, telecommunication, internet, computer hardware and multimedia. As for focus area of application it covers learning system and learning content. Meanwhile, factors for focus area of competency they include the ICT competency of school staff, teachers, principal and school administrator. Lastly, focus area of utilization embraces factors of ICT application in learning and teaching activities and school administration process and ICT based school planning and policy. The indicator variables of this measurement method is defined in 4x4 indicator matrix, vertically it shows four level adoption and horizontally it shows four focus areas. Therefore, ICT adoption level as elucidated in four focus areas for each adoption level. Every factor in each adoption level of a focus area has its own indicators, for example student-to-computer ratio (SCR) which is an indicator generally used in many countries. Measurement result from all factors will reflect the schools ICT adoption level either in emerging level, applying level, infusing level or transforming level. © 2012 IEEE.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Competitive advantage is the main reason why the company adopts new technology. Not all ERP implementation, however, can give competitive advantage to a company. While it might sound ridiculous, a company's competitive benefit is affected by the company's business strategy other than by the technology it implements and how much the strategy and the technology are aligned. Besides, many factors influence ERP implementation success in order to give a competitive advantage. On this study, we focused on two factors that influence it, namely: organization maturity level and ERP implementation approach. We applied the path analysis to identify significant correlation among the organization maturity level, ERP implementation approach, ERP implementation success and competitive advantage. Seven companies were chosen as the object of the study, covering four different industrial sectors, namely: Telecommunication, manufacturing, automotive and oil &amp; gas companies. Survey result showed that the ERP implementation success does not always give the competitive advantage for the organization. It shows on path coefficient between ERP implementation success (Y) and competitive advantage (Y1) is 0.048. It is also found that organization maturity level (X1) is more determine the competitive advantage rather than ERP implementation approach (X2). It is discovered that path coefficient between X1 and Y1 is 0.224. On the other hand, the path coefficient between X2 and Y1 is 0.127. The finding is also expected to improve knowledge in Enterprise System, Management Information System and on Creating Competitive Advantage through ERP Implementation. © 2011 IADIS.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>This paper presents a step-wise approach toward ERP implementation success, since the success of ERP system is considered an important issue. This approach builds on ERP life cycle that contains five stages, namely: project preparation, technology selection, project formulation, implementation/development and deployment. Each stage involves key success factors (KSFs) that influence the ERP implementation success. To address the study objectives, a survey questionnaire was considered the most appropriate research method. It was sent to 74 companies that have been implementing ERP system for at least one year. The respondents were staff at management level, IT staff and users involved in the development and use of the ERP system. The survey received 248 responses from 740 quesitionnaires that were sent to the companies. A quantitative analysis was applied to identify the weighting of KSFs toward ERP implementation success. The ERP implementation success can be measured through five indicators, namely: system quality, information quality, service quality, tactical impact and strategical impact. The weighting of KSFs will be applied on each stage of ERP life cycle. The step-wise approach guaranteed each stage can move forward due to the weighting of KSF fulfillment.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>The research was a preliminary study aimed at finding the relationship between the organization maturity level, implementation approach and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation success. Seven companies which have implemented ERP system to support their operational were chosen as the object of the study, covering four different industrial sectors, namely: telecommunication, manufacturing, automotive and oil &amp;amp; gas companies. To address the study objectives, a survey of 35 respondents from these 7 companies was conducted. Survey results showed that based on Information System (IS) Roles, 29.05% of the companies were in the strategic level, 22.30% were in the managerial level and 48.65% were in the operational level. This demonstrates that organization maturity level did not automatically drive the organization to implement ERP. Other factors like technology trend, goverment policy, bank policy, political issue were more dominant factors to drive organization to adopt ERP rather than maturity level. The result of the study also shows that there is no pattern of relationship between organization maturity level and ERP implementation success. This implies that the implementation of ERP in those companies have been done trivially. The ERP Implementation Approach (X2) has more significant influence than does the Organization Maturity Level (X1) on ERP Implementation Success (Y). Based on Pearson Correlation Test, it is discovered that coefficient correlation between X1 and Y is 0.312. On the other hand, the coefficient correlation between X2 and Y is 0.703. It is also found that X1 and X2 do not have multicollinearity as an independent variables.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>Changes in technology is always followed by changes in process and sometimes the process change is harder than the technology change itself. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is one of the software technology that emphasize business tranformation which will lead to process change in its effort to maximize the company's benefit. ERP implementation always give impact to organization, both strategic and tactical. In the organization hierachy, strategical impact affects the top level of organization hierarchy while tactical impact affects the operational and managerial level. The study focuses on the exploration of strategical and tactical impact induced by the implementation of ERP and to find out the corelation among ERP implementation success with the strategical and tactical impact. Thirty-five respondents from 7 companies become the sample that represent four different industrial sectors (oil &amp;amp; service, manufacturing, telecommunication, automotive). It is found that ERP implementation gives more impact on tactical level than on strategical level. This is derived from data analysis using Spearman rank test which shows that ρyx1 = 0.167 (not significant with p&amp;lt;0.05) and ρyx2 = 0.813 (significant with p&amp;lt;0.01). Thus, specific for Indonesian companies, the present study shows that ERP implementation acts only as support toward the core business instead of creating a competitive advantage. The reasons behind this conclusion lie in the fact that the companies only implement standard modules, such as: logistik, sales, financial, production, human resource, maintenance, without considering the application of specific modul (such as: Business Information Warehouse, Business Inteligence, CRM, SCM, etc.) for supporting the company's strategic level. Furthermore, ERP implementations in Indonesia are mainly driven by the technology itself, rather than the company's business needs.</dc:abstract>

	<dc:abstract>IPv6 has come with a package of advantages including simple header format, very large address space and extensibility. However, IPv6 packets transmission still uses the traditional infrastructure of protocol stacks such as TCP/IP. Thus, the big advantages cannot be taken optimally. One of the limitations of TCP/IP is duplication of error detection code verification and regeneration in Data Link layer. Every router has to verify CRC code at incoming port and regenerate the CRC code at outgoing port before forward an IPv6 packet to the next router. With advance networking technology this is a time consuming task. This paper proposes CRC Extension Header (CEH) to do error detection in Network layer and replaces the current error detection in Data Link layer. In CEH, verification of CRC code is only done in the final destination indicated by destination address field of IPv6 header. Experimentation results showed network latency of IPv6 packets transmission decreases 68%. © 2010 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.</dc:abstract>
